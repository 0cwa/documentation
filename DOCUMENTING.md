### Basics

1. Qovery's documentation is located in the [website/docs](./website/docs) folder.
2. If a file contains an "AUTOGENERATED" warning at the top, do not modify the file directly. Instead modify the referenced template.
3. Reference documents ([website/docs/reference](./website/docs/reference)) are generated automatically using specs found in [.meta](./.meta).
4. Run `make generate` to re-generate files.

### Running

The documentation site is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) and
can be found in the [website](./website) folder. You can read more about how it works and how to run it locally in [the README](./website/README.md).

### Scripting

Qovery documentation is mostly generated using Ruby, where the scripts can be found within the [scripts](./scripts) folder. You can read more about these
scripts in [the README](./scripts/README.md).
