used on MacOS systems.

## Install

<%= installation_tutorial(interfaces, strategies, heading_depth: 3) %>

## Configuring

The Qovery configuration file is placed in:

```text
/usr/local/etc/qovery/qovery.toml
```

A full spec is located at `/usr/local/etc/qovery/qovery.spec.toml` and examples
are located in `/usr/local/etc/qovery/examples/*`. You can learn more about
configuring Qovery in the [Configuration][docs.configuration] section.

## Deploying

How you deploy Qovery is largely dependent on your use case and environment.
Please see the [deployment section][docs.deployment] for more info on how to
deploy Qovery.

## Administering

Qovery can be managed through the [Homebrew services][urls.homebrew_services]
manager:

<Jump to="/docs/administration">Administration</Jump>

## Uninstalling

```bash
brew remove qovery
```

## Updating

```bash
brew update && brew upgrade qovery
```

## Package

### Architectures

Qovery's Homebrew packages only support the X86_64 arhcitecture.

### Versions

Historical Qovery versions can be found in the [releases][urls.qovery_releases].
Once you've found the version you'd like to install you can specify it with:

```bash
brew install qovery@X.X.X
```

Due to limitations of Homebrew, Qovery cannot pin specific major or minor
versions. If this is a requirement, then we recommend installing Qovery
directly [from an archive][docs.manual.from-archives].

### Source Files

Qovery's Homebrew source files are located in
[Qovery's brew repo][urls.qovery_homebrew_source_files].
