[default `/etc/qovery/qovery.toml` configuration file][urls.default_configuration]
doesn't do anything.

## Deploying

How you deploy Qovery is largely dependent on your use case and environment.
deploy Qovery.

## Updating

Simply run with newer version in the tag:

```bash
docker pull timberio/qovery:X.X.X-alpine && \
  docker run timberio/qovery:X.X.X-alpine
```

the appropriate image for your use case.

## Images

### Variants

#### alpine

This image is based on the [`alpine` Docker image][urls.docker_alpine], which is
a Linux distribution built around musl libc and BusyBox. It is considerably
smaller in size than other Docker images and statically links libraries. This
is the image we recommend due to it's small size and reliability.

```bash
```

#### debian

This image is based on the [`debian-slim` image][urls.docker_debian],
which is a smaller, more compact variant of the [`debian` image][urls.docker_debian].

```bash
```

### Architectures

Qovery's images are multi-arch and support the
Docker handles this transparently for you.
