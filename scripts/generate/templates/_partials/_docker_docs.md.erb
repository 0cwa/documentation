## Configuring

As shown above, you can pass a custom
[Qovery configuration file][docs.configuration] via the `-v` flag. You'll want
to do this since the
[default `/etc/qovery/qovery.toml` configuration file][urls.default_configuration]
doesn't do anything.

## Deploying

How you deploy Qovery is largely dependent on your use case and environment.
Please see the [deployment section][docs.deployment] for more info on how to
deploy Qovery.

## Updating

Simply run with newer version in the tag:

```bash
docker pull timberio/qovery:X.X.X-alpine && \
  docker run timberio/qovery:X.X.X-alpine
```

See the [variants](#variants) and [versions](#versions) sections to choose
the appropriate image for your use case.

## Images

### Variants

#### alpine

This image is based on the [`alpine` Docker image][urls.docker_alpine], which is
a Linux distribution built around musl libc and BusyBox. It is considerably
smaller in size than other Docker images and statically links libraries. This
is the image we recommend due to it's small size and reliability.

```bash
docker run timberio/qovery:<%= metadata.latest_version %>-alpine
```

#### debian

This image is based on the [`debian-slim` image][urls.docker_debian],
which is a smaller, more compact variant of the [`debian` image][urls.docker_debian].

```bash
docker run timberio/qovery:<%= metadata.latest_version %>-debian
```

### Architectures

Qovery's images are multi-arch and support the
<%= metadata.installation.platforms.docker.archs.to_sentence %> architectures.
Docker handles this transparently for you.
