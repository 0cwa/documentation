### Configuring

The Qovery configuration file is located at:

```text
config/qovery.toml
```

A full spec is located at `config/qovery.spec.toml` and examples are
located in `config/qovery/examples/*`. You can learn more about configuring

### Data Directory

We highly recommend creating a [data directory][docs.global-options#data_dir]
that Qovery can use:

```bash
mkdir /var/lib/qovery
```

<Alert type="warning">

Make sure that this directory is writable by the `qovery` process.

</Alert>

Qovery offers a global [`data_dir` option][docs.global-options#data_dir] that
you can use to specify the path of your directory.

```toml title="qovery.toml"
data_dir = "/var/lib/qovery" # default
```

### Service Managers

Qovery archives ship with service files in case you need them:

To install Qovery into Init.d run:

```bash
cp -av <%= distribution_dir %>/init.d/qovery /etc/init.d

To install Qovery into Systemd run:

```bash
cp -av <%= distribution_dir %>/systemd/qovery.service /etc/systemd/system
