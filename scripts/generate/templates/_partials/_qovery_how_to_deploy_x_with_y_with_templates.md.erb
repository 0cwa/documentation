[AWS][urls.aws] (Amazon Web Services) is a fantastic and reliable cloud service provider. AWS, like [GCP][urls.gcp] (Google Cloud Platform) and Microsoft [Azure][urls.azure], provides everything you need to host an application without having to worry about running the underlying servers and network configuration.

However, deploying an application on any of those cloud providers presents many challenges. The typical deployment workflow looks like this: write code, push it to Git repository, compile code, deploy code, validate your changes, and repeat. Developers not only have to take care of all of this by themselves, but they also have to configure tons of services (like VPCs, databases, caches, DNS, CDN, and others) to make their application live on the web.

Qovery solves this problem by combining the reliability of AWS and the simplicity of Heroku to augment the developer experience and to take this configuration burden from developers shoulders.

In this blog post, I will show you how Qovery improves developers' workflows by deploying staging and production [<%= x %>][<%= x_url %>] application with [<%= y %>][<%= y_url %>] database on Qovery. You will be able to focus on writing the best code and delivering business value instead of managing complex services.

<Assumptions name="guide">

* Your Operating System is macOS / Windows / Linux
* You have a [Github][urls.github] account

</Assumptions>

## Setup Qovery

<%= qovery_sign_up() %>

## Deployment

### <%= x %> sample application
To bootstrap the <%= x %> sample project, we'll use a `template`. [Templates][urls.qovery_templates_docs] are preconfigured basic project structures that allow you to create application skeleton using just one command. To bootstrap the application, run:

```bash
$ qovery init -t <%= template_name %>
```

This command creates a new directory with initial application structure configured to be deployed on Qovery.

### About configuration
To deploy your <%= x %> application connected to a <%= y %>, you need to have a `.qovery.yml` file, and a `Dockerfile` (both provided in the template skeleton) at the root of your project.

<Alert>
The .qovery.yml file describes all the dependencies that your application needs (e.g., <%= y %>) to work smoothly
</Alert>

In this example we are using <%= y %> v<%= y_version %>

After running `template` command, you can check the content of `.qovery.yml` in the folder containing your new application:

```bash
$ cat .qovery.yml
```

```yaml title=".qovery.yml"
application:
  name: my-application
  project: my-project
  cloud_region: aws/us-west-2
  publicly_accessible: true
databases:
- type: <%= y.downcase %>
  version: "<%= y_version %>"
  name: my-db
routers:
- name: main
  routes:
  - application_name: my-application
    paths:
    - /
```

All you have to do now to deploy the application is to initialize a new Github repository and grant Qovery access to this newly created repo:

<Steps headingDepth={3}>

  1. Create a new repository @ [Github][urls.github].

  2. [Authorize the Qovery Github application][urls.authorize_qovery] to get access to your Github account. Make sure it has access to repositories containing application you want to deploy with Qovery.

  3. Go to the new application folder:

  ```bash
  cd <%= template_name %>
  ```

  4. Connect your local Git repository to the newly created Github repo (don't forget to replace placeholders in the command):

  ```bash
  git remote add origin https://github.com/${YOUR_USERNAME}/${YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME}.git
  ```
  5. Push initial commit:

  ```bash
  git push --set-upstream origin master
  ```

  Voila! Your application is now being deployed to Qovery.

</Steps>

### Connect your application to <%= y %>
Credentials of your database are available via environment variables. Qovery injects environment vars at the runtime.
To list all the environment variables available to your application, execute the follwing in your application folder:

```bash
# List all environment variables
$ qovery project env list
```

```bash title="Output"
SCOPE    | KEY                                                      | VALUE
BUILT_IN | QOVERY_JSON_B64                                          | <base64>
BUILT_IN | QOVERY_BRANCH_NAME                                       | master
BUILT_IN | QOVERY_IS_PRODUCTION                                     | true
BUILT_IN | QOVERY_MY_APPLICATION_HOSTNAME                           | <hidden>
BUILT_IN | QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_DB_DATABASE                           | <hidden>
BUILT_IN | QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_DB_PASSWORD                           | <hidden>
BUILT_IN | QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_DB_USERNAME                           | <hidden>
BUILT_IN | QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_DB_PORT                               | <hidden>
BUILT_IN | QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_DB_FQDN                               | <hidden>
BUILT_IN | QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_DB_HOST                               | <hidden>
BUILT_IN | QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_DB_CONNECTION_URI_WITHOUT_CREDENTIALS | <hidden>
BUILT_IN | QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_DB_CONNECTION_URI                     | <hidden>
BUILT_IN | QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_DB_VERSION                            | <%= y_version %>
BUILT_IN | QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_DB_TYPE                               | <%= y %>
BUILT_IN | QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_DB_NAME                               | my-db
```

The sample application is preconfigured to use those environment variables to connect to the database.

See the deployment status by executing:

```bash
# Show your deployment status
$ qovery status
```

```bash title="Output"
BRANCH NAME | STATUS  | ENDPOINTS                                   | APPLICATIONS    | DATABASES
master      | running | https://main-abcdefgh12345678-gtw.qovery.io | my-application  | my-db

APPLICATION NAME  | STATUS  | DATABASES
my-application    | running | my-db

DATABASE NAME    | STATUS  | TYPE       | VERSION | ENDPOINT | PORT     | USERNAME | PASSWORD | APPLICATIONS
my-db            | running | <%= y.upcase %>      | <%= y_version %>     | <hidden> | <hidden> | <hidden> | <hidden> | my-application
```

As you see in the status output, the application as well as the database are automagically deployed. When your application `status` is `running`, you can use a browser or `curl` to access its endpoints.

## Trigger a new deployment

Now, you can play with the sample application and commit & push your changes. Qovery detects your actions and triggers new builds and application deployments. Any change you make will be reflected in your deployed application automatically.

## Bonuses (optional)
### Test the <%= x %> application locally
The Qovery motto is: if your application runs locally, it runs well on Qovery, too. To test if your application is running locally, execute the following command:

<Alert>
The Docker runtime is required
</Alert>

```bash
$ qovery run
```

Note: `qovery run` connects your application to the <%= y %> database on Qovery.

### Deploy the application on a staging environment
Qovery has a compelling feature known as `environments`. Qovery supports the deployment of isolated development environments that reflect your Git branches. Environments are complete copies of all of your data, application, and services like databases. The Environment is useful for testing changes in isolation before merging them to your main branch.

So, do you want to create a new feature, fix a bug, or make modifications without impacting the production or any other important environment? Type the following commands:

```bash
$ git checkout -b feat_foo
$ git push -u origin feat_foo

# show deployment status
$ qovery status
```

```bash title="Output"
BRANCH NAME | STATUS  | ENDPOINTS                                   | APPLICATIONS    | DATABASES
feat_foo    | running | https://main-yenr7erjbs87dk4m-gtw.qovery.io | my-application  | my-db

APPLICATION NAME      | STATUS  | DATABASES
docker-simple-example | running | my-db

DATABASE NAME  | STATUS  | TYPE       | VERSION | ENDPOINT | PORT     | USERNAME | PASSWORD | APPLICATIONS
my-db          | running | <%= y %>      | <%= y_version %>     | <hidden> | <hidden> | <hidden> | <hidden> | my-application
```

As you see, a new environment related to `feat_foo` branch is now running. New environment includes all applications and databases of your project, so you can test
new features in environment that is an identical copy of your production environment (we even replicate the database data!).
