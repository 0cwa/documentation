[AWS][urls.aws] (Amazon Web Services) is a fantastic and reliable cloud service provider. AWS, like [GCP][urls.gcp] (Google Cloud Platform) and Microsoft [Azure][urls.azure], provides everything you need to host an application without having to worry about running the underlying servers and network configuration.

However, deploying an application on AWS presents some challenges. The typical deployment workflow looks like this: write code, push it to Git, compile code, deploy code, validate your changes, and repeat. Developers thus not only have to do all of this manually, but they also have to configure tons of services (VPC, database, cache, DNS, CDN, etc.) to make their application live on the web.

Qovery solves this problem.
