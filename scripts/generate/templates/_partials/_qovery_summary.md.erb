Qovery helps you to seamlessly deploy your full-stack and micro-services applications on [AWS][docs.using-qovery.configuration.business.cloud-account.amazon-web-services], and [few other Cloud providers][docs.using-qovery.configuration.business.cloud-account].

## How Qovery works

Deploying an application with Qovery is as simple as pushing your code with Git.

<Steps headingDepth={3} hideFeedbackQuestion>

1. ### Connect your repository
Qovery is fully integrated into Github, Bitbucket, and Gitlab. After you push your code, Qovery runs all the necessary steps to make your application available online.

2. ### Write your best code
Using Qovery, all you need to do to grow your product is to implement business features. Focus on your code - no more tedious infrastructure management!

3. ### Push your code
Push your code - we handle the rest. From building your application to deploying to multiple environments.

## Important features

### One branch = one environment

</p>

On Qovery, every branch is an isolated environment. Creating a new Git branch results in a complete copy of your production environment, so developers can test new features quicker and introduce fewer bugs to production.

### Use your own cloud account <BusinessBadge />
It is very convenient to deploy side projects and early stage applications on Qovery infrastructure. However, if your organization grows, you may want to run your business on your own cloud account to have greater control, reduce costs or use your cloud provider credits. In this case Qovery got you covered - not only it allows to deploy your environments on your own cloud account, but also it's provider agnostic, making it possible to deploy your production environment on more expensive, reliable cloud and use cheaper providers for your development envs.

### Bring your own CI <BusinessBadge />
[Qovery Engine][urls.qovery_engine] can build your application Docker images. If your organization already use another CI solution, you can easily configure Qovery to use it instead. You can also configure where your application's Docker images are stored.

## Why you should use Qovery?

What's more, we took on our shoulders the complexity of providing and managing other infrastructure requirements you need (like databases or message brokers), so you can focus merely on developing business features.

### Simple and Powerful
With Qovery, the cloud is simple again. Get all the benefits of using cloud and Kubernetes without dealing with its complexity. You don't need to hire infrastructure experts - configuring continuous integration, deployment, databases, message brokers, storage, DNS, SSL/TLS, VPCs, and many others - we do it all for you. On Qovery, you can spin up a set of microservices, databases, and other cloud services in minutes with a single Git push!

###  Built for all developers
