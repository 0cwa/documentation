To quickly learn how to use Qovery, we recommend you to follow our **Getting Started Guide**, which covers all the most important concepts you may
need while developing your applications with Qovery.
<Jump to="/guides/getting-started/">Getting Started Guide</Jump>

If you don't want to learn more now, you can simply deploy your first application following just **three** steps from below and get back to the
**Getting Started Guide** later on.

## Sign Up

<%= qovery_sign_up() %>

## Create an Application

To show you how it's simple to build and deploy your applications on Qovery, we have prepared a sample project.

### Fork a sample application

Fork a [sample application][urls.sample_application] by clicking on the `Fork` button:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/github_fork.png" alt="Fork Sample Application" />
</p>

After it's done, clone your forked repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:<your-github-nickname>/simple-example.git
cd simple-example
```

**In this repository, you'll find an already existing Dockerfile able to build and run the application.**

### Initialize Qovery

In order to be able to deploy this application using Qovery, you have to bootstrap the configuration file:

```bash
$ qovery init
Reply to the following questions to initialize Qovery for this application
For more info: https://docs.qovery.com

âž¤ Choose your action:
1. Create a new project
2. Select an existing project
âž¤ Your choice: 1

âž¤ Enter the project name: project-demo

âž¤ Choose the region to host your applications:
1. aws/eu-west-3
âž¤ Your choice: 1

âž¤ Enter the application name [default: simple-example]: demo

âž¤ Do you need a database? (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, ...) (y/n) [default=n]: n
âœ“ Your Qovery configuration file has been successfully created! (.qovery.yml)

!!!IMPORTANT!!!
Qovery needs to get access to your git repository
https://github.com/apps/qovery/installations/new

âž¤ Would you like to open the link above? (y/n) [default=n]: y

!!!IMPORTANT!!!
1/ Commit and push the ".qovery.yml" file to get your app deployed
âž¤ Run: git add .qovery.yml && git commit -m "add .qovery.yml" && git push -u origin master

2/ Check the status of your deployment
âž¤ Run: qovery status

Enjoy! ðŸ‘‹
```

We need to get the access to your Git repository to be able to build a Docker image container and access your `.qovery.yml` configuration file.

You'll have to grant Qovery (only the first time) access to your repository:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/gh_install_qovery.png" alt="Provide  Access To Repository" />
</p>

Then, you'll see Qovery access permissions:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/gh_qovery_access.png" alt="Repository Permissions" />
</p>

**You can grant Qovery access to all repositories or just those you use with Qovery.**

## Deploy!

After you have initialized Qovery configuration and gave the permissions to access your repository, all you have to do to deploy your application
is to commit and push your changes:

```bash
git add .qovery.yml
git commit -m "Adding first Qovery configuration" .qovery.yml
git push
```

**That's it! We'll detect changes in your repository and build and deploy your application.**

### Check the deployment status

To check the status of your application, run `qovery status` command:

```bash
qovery status
```

### Push new changes

From now on, any changes in your remote Git repository will trigger a CI/CD pipeline that will build and deploy your application. Enjoy!
