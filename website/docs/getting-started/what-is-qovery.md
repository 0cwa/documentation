## Deploy complex applications, seamlessly

** Push your code, we handle the rest.**

**Qovery** is a platform that combines the power of **Kubernetes**, the reliability of **AWS**, and the simplicity of **Heroku** to augment the
developer experience. It accelerates and scales the application development cycle with zero infrastructure management investment.

## Git Workflows

Deploying an application with Qovery is as simple as pushing your code with Git.

<Steps headingDepth={3} hideFeedbackQuestion>

1.  ### Connect your repository
    Qovery is fully integrated into Github, Bitbucket, and Gitlab. After you push your code, Qovery runs all the necessary steps to make your application available online.

2.  ### Write your best code
    Using Qovery, all you need to do to grow your product is to implement business features. Focus on your code - no more tedious infrastructure management!

3.  ### Push your code
    Push your code - we handle the rest. From building your application to deploying to multiple environments.

4.  ### New branch = New environment
    On Qovery, every branch is an isolated environment. Creating a new Git branch results in a complete copy of your production environment, so developers can test new features quicker and introduce fewer bugs to production.

</Steps>

## Rich selection of integrated services
Qovery integrates, provisions, and manages all kinds of services and infrastructure dependencies your application may need. Adding databases, storage, message brokers, and other services has never been that easy - add a few lines of configuration, and we handle the rest!

## The power of Kubernetes, reliability of AWS, and the simplicity of Heroku

Under the hood, Qovery uses **containers** and **Kubernetes** to run applications. With us, your applications scale accordingly to your traffic and needs. We rely on
major cloud providers to provide reliable infrastructure to make your applications highly available. What's more, we took on our shoulders the complexity of providing
and managing other infrastructure requirements you need (like databases or message brokers), so you can focus merely on developing business features.

**With Qovery, the cloud is simple again**. Get all the benefits of using cloud and Kubernetes without dealing with its complexity. You don't need to hire infrastructure experts -
configuring continuous integration, deployment, databases, message brokers, storage, DNS, SSL/TLS, VPCs, and many others - we do it all for you.

####  Simplicity - built for all developers

Qovery is designed by developers for developers. Our goal is to make your life easier and allow you to move faster. Developer experience is at our heart. Building cloud-native applications was never that fast and simple!
