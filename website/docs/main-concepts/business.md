## Qovery Business

### Your apps, your cloud account // TODO DO THEY KNOW WHAT DOES IT MEAN?
One of the greatest benefits of moving to Business version is that your projects are deployed on your own cloud account.
We take care of the whole process of setting up your environment - from bootstrapping kubernetes clusters to application deployment.
All we need is the access to your cloud account. Of course, it's highly customizable, and you have the power to edit or override
the default behaviours!

### Your team, your rules
Each organization has its own unique approach to dealing with people, communication and teams. We value your uniqueness and thus
we give you superpowers to create very grained rules that mirror your business.

Create your own roles, split responsibilites, grant and revoke permissions, control techstack your team use
