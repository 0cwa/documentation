To build and run your applications in a reliable, reproductible way, Qovery uses Docker. Qovery provide you with
a platform for building your applications. Qovery engine is able to build your applications, but, if for some reason you
want to use other solution to build your images, you can very easily plug it in just by providing us with permissions and
telling us to use another solution.
