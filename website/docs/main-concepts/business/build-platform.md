To build and run your applications in a reliable, reproductible way, Qovery uses Docker. We provide you with
a platform for building your applications. Qovery Engine is able to build your applications, but if for some reason you
want to use other solution to build your images, you can very easily plug it in by just providing Qovery an access to your
build platform.
