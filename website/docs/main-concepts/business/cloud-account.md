Qovery has taken provider-agnostic approach to the cloud. Our Engine is able to support any cloud provider just by
implementing a set of interfaces. What it means to you, is that you can deploy your projects using multiple cloud accounts,
from multiple cloud providers!

Do you want to have a reliable production environment but also save money on development platforms which are not crucial?
No problem! You can deploy your reliable production system on AWS cloud account, and to save resources, deploy other non-production
systems on one of the cheaper providers. No problem at all! Qovery brings you real multicloud approach which is fully transparent for
application developers.

All you need to do to achieve real cloud-agnostic aproach is to provide us with credentials to your choosen cloud accounts
and declare a Policy to instruct us when to use given cloud provider. It's that simple!
