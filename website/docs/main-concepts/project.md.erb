A project is a **set of applications and their dependencies** (databases & other services). Today's software products are rarely made of just one application. 
To meet the needs of modern software architectures, Qovery natively supports projects with multiple apps. With Qovery, you can design your product as a set of independent applications (`microservices`). We take care of all the plumbing (network, resiliency, deployments) to let you focus on your business goals.
