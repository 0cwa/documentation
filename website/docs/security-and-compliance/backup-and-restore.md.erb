Backups and restore are frequently a nightmare to setup. Especially for databases. Qovery helps you to get this part **always automatically managed by the Cloud provider**.

## Backups

### Applications

When containers' applications are successfully built, **all containers are kept for possible future rollback**.

### Services

Take a look at the desired service to know how they are backed up.

## Restore

### Applications

As the Qovery configuration file is in your git repository and versioned, you can rollback any version when you want.

<Alert type="warning">

When you rollback a commit containing a Qovery configuration change, ensure there are no other changes to avoid unwanted behavior.
