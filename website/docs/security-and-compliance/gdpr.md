## Data Protection by Design
We've implemented policies in the company to ensure all of our employees follow the necessary training and protocols around security. Besides, privacy protection is part of every project during instantiation.

## Data Protection Officer
Appointment of a Security Officer, who also holds the Data Protection Officer (DPO) role. If you have any concern, [contact us][urls.qovery_contact_us].

## Consent
We've confirmed that all of our customer communication, both business-related and marketing-related, is opt-in, and no information is shared with us without a customer's consent.

## Enhanced Rights
The GDPR provides rights to individuals, such as the right to portability, right of rectification, and the right to be forgotten. We've made sure we comply with these rights. Nearly all information can be edited through a user's account, and we can delete accounts upon request.

## Data Collection
We've documented information about what data we collect.

## Data Retention
We documented information about our data retention.
