Qovery can be installed through the [Nix package manager][urls.nix] via
[Qovery's Nix package][urls.qovery_nix_package]. This package manager is
generally used on [NixOS][urls.nixos].

<Alert type="warning">

Because Qovery must be manually updated on Nix, new Qovery releases will be
delayed. Generally new Qovery releases are made available within a few days.

</Alert>

## Install

<%= installation_tutorial(interfaces, strategies, heading_depth: 3) %>

## Configuring

The [Qovery nix package][urls.qovery_nix_package] does not install any
configuration files by default. You'll need to create a
[Qovery configuration file][docs.configuration] and pass it to Qovery via the
`--config` flag when [starting][docs.process-management#starting] Qovery.

## Deploying

How you deploy Qovery is largely dependent on your use case and environment.
Please see the [deployment section][docs.deployment] for more info on how to
deploy Qovery.

## Administering

The Qovery nix package does not use Systemd by default, but Qovery does provide
a [Systemd service file][urls.qovery_systemd_file] that you can use as a
starting point. How you manage the Qovery process is up to you, and the
process administration section covers how to do this:

## Uninstalling

```bash
nix-env --uninstall qovery
```

## Updating

```bash
nix-env --file https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/archive/master.tar.gz --upgrade qovery
```

## Package

### Architectures

Qovery's Nix packages only support the X86_64 architecture.

### Versions

Installing previous versions of Qovery through `nix` is possible, but not
straightforward. For example, installing Qovery `0.7.1` can be achieved with
the following command:

```bash
nix-env --file https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/archive/20bbe6cba68fb9d37b5d0e373b6180dce2961e0d.tar.gz --install --attr qovery
```

`20bbe6...` represents the commit sha for the `0.7.1` on the
[nix package repo][urls.qovery_nix_package].

#### Listing Versions & Commit SHAs

For situations that required automated retrieval, we've thrown thogether this
handy Ruby function that will list the Qovery versions and their commit sha:

```ruby
require "net/http"
require "json"

# Returns a hash mapping Qovery versions to commits in `nixpkgs/nixos` repository
def nix_versions
  nixpkgs_repo = "nixos/nixpkgs"
  commits_url = "https://api.github.com/repos/#{nixpkgs_repo}/commits?path=pkgs/tools/misc/qovery"

  response = Net::HTTP.get URI(commits_url)
  items = JSON.parse response

  versions = {}
  for item in items do
    match = item["commit"]["message"].match "^qovery:.*(\\d+\.\\d+\.\\d+)$"
    if match
      version = match[1]
      versions[version] = item["sha"]
    end
  end

  versions
end
```

### Source Files

Qovery's Nix source files are located in the
[Nix repo][urls.qovery_nix_package].
