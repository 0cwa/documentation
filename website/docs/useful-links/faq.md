### What is the difference between a Project,  Application, and Environment?

A project is the site that you're working on. Each project can contain multiple applications and be deployed in multiple environments.
An environment is a standalone copy of your site, including apps, databases, storage, data, and all other services. By default, `master` branch is the production environment, while all other branches can be set up as identical copies of the prod environment for testing purposes. 

### Are databases backed-up?

Yes, Qovery databases rely on Managed Services provided by AWS (Amazon Web Services) and other major cloud providers. All databases are fully backed-up every day and incrementally on each write.

### Is Qovery production ready?
Qovery is in beta stage. We hope to have a production-ready version of Qovery in June 2020.

### Where are your servers located?
We rely mostly on AWS infrastructure. Thus, our servers are available all over the world, including the US, Europe, and Asia.
