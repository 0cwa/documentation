## What is the difference between a Project, Application, and Environment?

A [project][docs.using-qovery.configuration.project] is the site that you're working on. Each project can contain multiple [applications][docs.using-qovery.configuration.application] and be deployed in multiple [environments][docs.using-qovery.configuration.environment]. An environment is a standalone copy of your site, including apps, databases, storage, data, and all other services. By default, `main` branch is the production environment, while all other branches can be set up as identical copies of the prod environment for testing purposes.

## How does application build works?

Basically, Qovery deploys your application as a container. Check out the detailed explanation of what is going on behind the scene [here][docs.devops.qovery-for-devops-introduction#application-and-database-deployment]

## How does Qovery manage databases?

Qovery provides `managed` and `container` modes for your databases. Basically, `managed` mode relies on the managed database provided by the cloud provider. E.g. if you choose `Postgres` with the `managed` mode while your environment is running on AWS, then Qovery provides an [AWS RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds) instance. Please check out our [database section][docs.using-qovery.configuration.database] for further details.

## Does Qovery replace Kubernetes?

Behind the scene, Qovery uses [Kubernetes][urls.kubernetes]. Qovery extends Kubernetes to make it accessible to any developer teams.
Important: Qovery does not modify Kubernetes. It only deploys his services in a `qovery` Kubernetes namespace.

## Does Qovery support mono repository?

Yes, absolutely! Check out [our monorepo guide][guides.advanced.monorepository].

## Does Qovery support microservices?

Yes, absolutely! Check out [our microservices guide][guides.advanced.microservices].

## What Git providers do you support?

GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket.

## Do you support GitHub Enterprise or Gitlab Self-hosted?

Not at the moment, but you can upvote for this feature in [our roadmap][urls.qovery_roadmap].

## Does Qovery support private Git repository ?

Yes, absolutely!

## What is the IP address of my Kubernetes cluster?

Static IP is only supported for Kubernetes clusters running on AWS. You can enable the option in the feature settings of your cluster.

## If I have N custom domains under the same root domain, do I need to create N CNAME records, or just creating one for the root domain is enough ?

You have to create N CNAME, one per custom domain

## I have made actions on my AWS account and want to clean my organization in order to restart from scratch, how can I proceed ?

If you want to remove Qovery infrastructure from your AWS account in order to restart from the beginning, or if you are leaving Qovery and want to delete Qovery infrastructure from your AWS account, you can do that buy clicking on "delete infrastraucture" on your Organization page:
