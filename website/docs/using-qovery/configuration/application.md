<Assumptions name="documentation">

You have created an [Environment][docs.using-qovery.configuration.environment].

</Assumptions>

An **application** is part of a [Project][docs.using-qovery.configuration.project] within an [Environment][docs.using-qovery.configuration.environment] and is a container unit. Multiple applications can be part of the same [Environment][docs.using-qovery.configuration.environment], be connected to a set of dependencies (databases and other services), and can communicate with other applications within the same Environment.

## Configuration

### General

General settings allow you to set up your application name, git repository and build mode.

#### Git Repository

- Configure your repository URL (it can be hosted on Github or Gitlab, Bitbucket support coming soon).
- Select branch that Qovery should use for builds in this environment
- Select `Root Application Path` - base folder in which the application resides in your repository

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/configuration/application/app-17.png" alt="CPU" />
</p>

<Alert type="info">

Qovery supports monorepositories, you can deploy multiple apps using single repository. [For details, see our advanced guide.][guides.advanced.monorepository]

</Alert>

#### Build Mode

#### Option 1: Buildpacks

To simplify application build for the developer, Qovery supports [Buildpacks](https://buildpacks.io) out of the box. Buildpacks determine the build process for an app, and which assets and runtimes should be made available to your code at runtime. If your complex apps are running multiple languages, you can also use multiple buildpacks within a single app.
Meaning, as a developer, you don't need to write a `Dockerfile` to build and run your app. Qovery Buildpacks takes care of everything for you.

**Supported languages**

| language   | version |
|------------|---------|
| Ruby       | any     |
| Java       | any     |
| Node.JS    | any     |
| Python     | any     |
| Javascript | any     |
| Typescript | any     |
| Python     | any     |
| Golang     | any     |
| PHP        | any     |

#### Option 2: Dockerfile

Qovery runs your application within the [Container technology](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container). To build and run your application, you need to provide a valid [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder).

```Dockerfile title="Valid NodeJS Dockerfile"
FROM node:13-alpine
RUN mkdir -p /usr/src/app
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY . .
RUN npm install
EXPOSE 3000
CMD node ./bin/www
```

After creating a Dockerfile, specify the location of your Dockerfile in `Dockefile path` field.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/configuration/application/app-12.png" alt="Dockerfile" />
</p>

Configuration from above will make Qovery look for the Dockerfile in `/app1/Dockerfile` path of your repository (`Root Application Path` + `Dockerfile Path`).

### Resources

#### CPU

To configure the number of CPUs that your app needs, adjust the setting in `Resources` section of application configuration.

<Alert type="info">

Default is 256m. Maximum you can set is 1CPU in `Community` version, and unlimited in `Startup` and higher plans.

</Alert>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/configuration/application/app-13.png" alt="CPU" />
</p>

#### RAM

To configure the amout of RAM that your app needs, adjust the setting in `Resources` section of application configuration.

<Alert type="info">

Default is 256MB, maximum you can set is 512MB in `Community` version, and unlimited in `Startup` and higher plans.

</Alert>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/configuration/application/app-14.png" alt="RAM" />
</p>

### Dependencies

Qovery gives you the power to have multiple apps within one environment. Sometimes it's necessary to one or multiple apps before others.
By using `Dependency` configuration you can declare a list of apps your app is depending on.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/configuration/application/app-6.png" alt="Application Dependencies" />
</p>

Setting up application dependencies will make sure all the dependencies are running before your application starts.

### Storage

#### Block Storage

The default filesystem for applications running on Qovery is ephemeral. Application data isn’t persisted across deploys and restarts, which works just fine for most apps because they use managed databases to persist data.

However, many applications need persistent disk storage that isn’t ephemeral. These include:

* Blogging platforms and CMSs like WordPress, Ghost, and Strapi.
* Collaboration apps like Mattermost, GitLab, and Discourse.

This is where Qovery block Storage comes in. Qovery applications can use storage to store data that persists across deploys and restarts, making it easy to deploy stateful applications.

<Alert type="warning">

For most use cases, it is better to use [Object Storage][docs.using-qovery.configuration.object-storage] instead of Block Storage.

</Alert>

###### Use cases

###### ✅ Good use cases

- For I/O intensive applications (E.g. database)
- To store temporary files

###### ❌ Bad use cases

- To store file > 1 TB
- To expose files from an application (E.g. images)

##### Types of Block Storage

Qovery Storage supports:

|Type|Max IOPS|Max Throughput|Min Size|Max Size|Use cases|
|----|--------|--------------|--------|--------|---------|
|fast_ssd|64000|1GB/s|5GB|10GB `Community` / 1TB `Startup` plans|Critical business applications that require sustained IOPS like databases|

##### Configuration

You can set up your Block Storage in `Storage` section of your application configuration.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/configuration/application/app-7.png" alt="Application Storage" />
</p>

### Ports

Most of application needs to be accessed by other services inside or outside of your environment. To set up the access,
declare ports your application uses. Internal ports are available internally inside your environment for other services to use.
You can also expose ports publicly - it makes them accessible over the public network.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/configuration/application/app-15.png" alt="Application Ports" />
</p>

### Domains

`Domain` section of your application configuration allows you to define a custom domain for your application.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/configuration/application/app-16.png" alt="Application Domains" />
</p>

After setting up a custom domain, you'll see a `Value` that you need to set up as `CNAME` record in your domain registrar.

<Alert type="info">

[We prepared a guide and video tutorial that explains how to set up your custom domain.][guides.getting-started.setting-custom-domain]

</Alert>

Setting up the `CNAME` on domain provider side will make your app accessible through your custom domain on Qovery.

### Database

To access your database in your application, link it to your application in `Database` section of your application configuration.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/configuration/application/app-10.png" alt="Application Databases" />
</p>

Linking database to your app will make sure it's up and running before your application starts. It will also ensure that database secrets and other important information are injected as secrets into your application.

Example of secrets and environment variables injected into your app for the linked database:

#### Database Secrets

```
"QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_POSTGRESQL_DATABASE": "postgres"
"QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD": "xxx"
"QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_POSTGRESQL_USERNAME": "superuser"
"QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_POSTGRESQL_PORT": "5432"
"QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_POSTGRESQL_FQDN": "my-postgresq-y1irp3nmdzj32yjl-svc.cnuxtlki1yn9.eu-west-3.rds.amazonaws.com"
"QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_POSTGRESQL_HOST": "my-postgresq-y1irp3nmdzj32yjl-svc.cnuxtlki1yn9.eu-west-3.rds.amazonaws.com"
"QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_POSTGRESQL_CONNECTION_URI_WITHOUT_CREDENTIALS": "postgresql://my-postgresq-y1irp3nmdzj32yjl-svc.cnuxtlki1yn9.eu-west-3.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/postgres"
"QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_POSTGRESQL_CONNECTION_URI": "postgresql://superuser:xxx@my-postgresq-y1irp3nmdzj32yjl-svc.cnuxtlki1yn9.eu-west-3.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/postgres"
"QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_POSTGRESQL_VERSION": "11.5"
"QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_POSTGRESQL_TYPE": "POSTGRESQL"
"QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_POSTGRESQL_NAME": "my-postgresql"
```

The built-in variables follow the naming pattern: `QOVERY_DATABASE` + <your_db_name> + <type_of_variable> where:

- `<your_db_name>` is the name of your database
- `<type_of_variable>` is the type of variable we inject, e.g. `PASSWORD`, `VERSION`, `CONNECTION_URI` and so on.
