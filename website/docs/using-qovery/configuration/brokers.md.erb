In the near future, Qovery will support RabbitMQ (vote [here](https://roadmap.qovery.com/c/24-managed-rabbitmq)) and Kafka (vote [here](https://roadmap.qovery.com/c/25-managed-kafka)) brokers.

In the meantime, you can use [External Service][docs.using-qovery.configuration.business.external-service] to plug any broker.
