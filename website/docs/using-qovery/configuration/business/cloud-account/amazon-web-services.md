## FAQ

### How to choose a region?

Different datacenters are located in different geographic areas, and you may want to keep your site physically close to the bulk of your user base for reduced latency.

### I don't find a region that is provided by AWS

We are probably testing the support of this region, please [contact us][urls.qovery_contact_us] to know what's the status

### Migrate between Cloud providers and regions

Today, you can't migrate an environment from one region to another after it has been created. Vote [here][urls.qovery_roadmap] if you need this feature.
