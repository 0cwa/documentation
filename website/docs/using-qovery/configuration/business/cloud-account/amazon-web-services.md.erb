## Getting started

<Assumptions>

* You have a [Qovery][docs.using-qovery.interface] account
* You have created an [Organization][docs.using-qovery.configuration.business.organization]

</Assumptions>

### Connect your AWS account

To link your AWS account to Qovery you need to provide an AWS `access key id` and `secret access key` with the [required IAM permissions][docs.using-qovery.configuration.business.cloud-account.amazon-web-services].

<Alert type="info">

You can link more than one AWS account. Qovery also support multiple Cloud providers within the same Organization. Which means that you can balance your workload on different Cloud providers. [Read more][guides.advanced.using-multiple-cloud-providers].

#### Create your AWS credentials - `access key id` and `secret access key`

<Steps headingDepth={3}>
<ol>

<li>

[Connect to your AWS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com)

</li>

<li>

Go to `My Security Credentials`
<img src="/img/aws-my-security-credentials.jpg" />

</li>

<li>

Create `Admins` group **without any permissions**

<img src="/img/aws-create-group-1.jpg" />
<img src="/img/aws-create-group-2.jpg" />
<img src="/img/aws-create-group-3.jpg" />
<img src="/img/aws-create-group-4.jpg" />

</li>

<li>

Create one IAM user called `qovery` with the <a href="/files/qovery-iam-aws.json">appropriate permissions</a>
<img src="/img/aws-create-user-1.jpg" />
<img src="/img/aws-create-user-2.jpg" />
<img src="/img/aws-create-user-3.jpg" />

Go to the last step and copy your `access key id` and `secret access key`.

<img src="/img/aws-create-user-4.jpg" />

</li>

</ol>

</Steps>

Well done!! You now have your AWS `access key id` and `secret access key`; It's time to connect Qovery to your AWS account.

- Autoscaling for RDS and autoscaling rules for the Kubernetes cluster
- Elastic load-balancing for ELB / ALB / NLB.
- DynamoDB to have a distributed lock on infrastructure deployment.
- ECR for managing the container registry, create/update/delete repository.
- KMS to load and store keys (RDS, SSH, …)
- EKS to create and update the Kubernetes cluster.
