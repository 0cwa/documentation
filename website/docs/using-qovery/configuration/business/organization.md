## Using Organization

To asign an application to an organization, put the organization name in the `.qovery.yml`:

```yaml title=".qovery.yml" {2}
application:
  organization: my-organization
  name: my-application
  project: project-x
  publicly_accessible: true
routers:
- name: main
  routes:
  - application_name: my-application
    paths:
    - /
```

This configuration deploys the application in `my-organization` organization.
