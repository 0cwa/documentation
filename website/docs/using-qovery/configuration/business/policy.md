description: "Learn how to configure Policies in Qovery"
---
Policy is a core concept of Qovery Business. It allows your team to customize the behaviours of the platform and adjust it perfectly to your organization's needs.

<img src="/img/policy-complete-flow.png"/>

For instance, you can create a rule to deploy the `master` [environment][docs.main-concepts.environment] into the AWS Cloud provider and by all apps contained into this environment with your Circle CI account.

**Default policies are set-up when you create an organization for the first time**. Then you can start to use Qovery Business in seconds.

## Policy scenarios

### Reduce development environment costs

<!--- Create a schema where we see that environment are automatically startup and shutdown -->

TODO

### Reduce the risk of production outage

<!--- Create a schema where we see that environment are deploy on different clusters depending if it is production or development -->

TODO

### Synchronize the staging environment with the production environment

<!--- Create a schema where we see two environment in synchronization -->
