Qovery lets you quickly deploy applications to your [Amazon Web Services (AWS)][urls.aws] account. No knowledge is needed, and it takes less than 20 minutes to install Qovery on your AWS account.

<Alert type="info">

Do you want to know more about how Qovery works on your AWS account? [Here][docs.useful-resources.faq#how-qovery-works-under-the-hood] is explained how Qovery works under the hood.

## Getting started

<Assumptions>

* You have a [Qovery][docs.using-qovery.interface] account
* You have created an [Organization][docs.using-qovery.configuration.organization]
* You have an AWS account

</Assumptions>

### Connect your AWS account

To link your AWS account to Qovery you need to provide an AWS `access key id` and `secret access key` with the [required IAM permissions][docs.using-qovery.configuration.cloud-service-provider.amazon-web-services].

<Alert type="info">

You can link more than one AWS account. Qovery also support multiple Cloud providers within the same Organization. Meaning, you can balance your workload on different Cloud providers. [Read more][guides.advanced].

#### Create your AWS credentials - `access key id` and `secret access key`

<Steps headingDepth={3}>
<ol>

<li>

[Connect to your AWS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com)

</li>

<li>

Go to `My Security Credentials`
<img src="/img/aws-my-security-credentials.jpg" />

</li>

<li>

Create `Admins` group **without any permissions**

<Alert type="warning">

The name of the group MUST be Admins. If you use another name, this will not work

</Alert>


<img src="/img/aws-create-group-1.jpg" />
<img src="/img/aws-create-group-2.jpg" />
<img src="/img/aws-create-group-3.jpg" />
<img src="/img/aws-create-group-4.jpg" />

</li>

<li>

Create one IAM user called `qovery`.
<img src="/img/aws-create-user-1.jpg" />
<img src="/img/aws-create-user-2.jpg" />
<img src="/img/aws-create-user-3.jpg" />

Go to the last step and copy your `access key id` and `secret access key`.

<img src="/img/aws-create-user-4.jpg" />

</li>

<li>

Setup<a href="/files/qovery-iam-aws.json"> IAM permissions</a> to the `qovery` user.
<img src="/img/aws-add-policy-1.jpg" />
<img src="/img/aws-add-policy-2.jpg" />

<a href="/files/qovery-iam-aws.json">Download permissions JSON</a>
<img src="/img/aws-add-policy-3.jpg" />
<img src="/img/aws-add-policy-4.jpg" />

</li>

</ol>

</Steps>

Well done!! You now have your AWS `access key id` and `secret access key` and your permissions are setups; It's time to connect Qovery to your AWS account.

#### Use AWS credentials with Qovery

<%= qovery_web_interface_coming_soon %>

### Remove your AWS account

<%= qovery_web_interface_coming_soon %>

### Delete Qovery from your AWS account

To delete Qovery from your AWS account you must be authenticated as the Organization admin. Once your AWS account removed from Qovery, everything configured (VPC, Kubernetes, ...) by Qovery will be deleted forever.

### IAM permissions

Qovery required IAM permissions to create, update and managed the infrastructure.

- IAM is used to create IAM roles
- S3 is used to store our generated configuration files
- Cloudwatch, for creating a group stream for each Kubernetes clusters
- Autoscaling for RDS and autoscaling rules for the Kubernetes cluster
- Elastic load-balancing for ELB / ALB / NLB.
- DynamoDB to have a distributed lock on infrastructure deployment.
- ECR for managing the container registry, create/update/delete repository.
- KMS to load and store keys (RDS, SSH, …)
- EKS to create and update the Kubernetes cluster.
