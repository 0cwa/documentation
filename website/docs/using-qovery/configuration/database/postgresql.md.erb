## Configuration

### General

#### Modes

Databases can operate in two modes:

- Managed
- Container

**Managed** databases are perfect for production - they are provided and managed by major cloud providers like AWS to make sure your production data is well managed.

**Container** databases are managed by Qovery as Docker containers with attached persistent storage. They are perfect for development and testing, as they are significantly cheaper than services provided by cloud providers.

<Alert type="warning">

Managed databases are supported only in [paid plans][urls.qovery_pricing], it's not available in the `Community` version.

</Alert>

#### Versions

Qovery supports the following PostgreSQL versions.

|Cloud provider|Version|Container supported|Managed supported|
|--------------|---------|-------|---------------------------|
|AWS|13|Yes|Yes|
|AWS|12|Yes|Yes|
|AWS|11|Yes|Yes|
|AWS|10|Yes|Yes|
|AWS|9|Yes|Yes|
|Digital Ocean|13|Yes|Soon|
|Digital Ocean|12|Yes|Soon|
|Digital Ocean|11|Yes|Soon|
|Digital Ocean|10|Yes|Soon|
|Digital Ocean|9|Yes|Soon|
|Scaleway|13|Yes|Yes|
|Scaleway|12|Yes|Yes|
|Scaleway|11|Yes|Yes|
|Scaleway|10|Yes|Yes|
|Scaleway|9|Yes|No|

You can adjust the version of your database in `General` section of database settings:

</p>

#### Accessibility

To make your database secure, you may decide not to expose it publicly.

- **Public** access will make your database accessible via the public network
- **Private** access will make your database accessible only by applications in your environment

You can configure the accessibility settings in `General` section of database settings:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/configuration/database/db-6.png" alt="Database Accessibility" />
</p>
