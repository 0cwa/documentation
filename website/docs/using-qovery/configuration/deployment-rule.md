## Why using Deployment Rule?

### Cloud cost optimization

Using the Deployment Rules is a good practice to drastically **reduce your cost**. Indeed, Qovery knows how to optimize your Cloud resources
when your applications are not running. Then you can expect to reduce your Cloud cost up to 60% by using the **Deployment Rules**.

### Time optimization

Configuring your environments, managing, starting, shutting down, it all takes the valuable time from your developers. Deployment Rules allow you
to declaratively set up how your resources should be used, and let Qovery do the dirty job, allowing your employees to focus on important things.

### Examples

#### Shutting down environments

Developers in your company work from 9-to-5, five days a week. During the weekend, at night, and off the working hours, keeping all development environments running
may be a huge expsense that gives you no benefits. 

Deployment Rules address this problem very effectively - all you need to do is to define when you need your environments to be running,
and let us handle the rest. Qovery will start and stop your services for you to make sure your cloud spending is optimized and wise.

#### Using cheaper cloud providers

Running your development environments on expensive cloud providers might not be the best way to spend your money. Depoyment Rules allow you to deploy
your development environments to a cheaper cloud account, while still keeping your production using the most reliable services provided by the more expensive cloud provider.

## Rule Levels

You can set up your Rules at **Project** and **Environment** level. Rules set up at the Project level will be automatically applied to Environment you select in the rule.
If, however, the default settings applied by the Project level rule does not meet your needs, you are allowed to override the settings at the Environment level.

## Project Deployment Rules

Declaring deployment rules at the project level allows you to apply reasonable defaults to all newly created environments. After a new environment within a project is created, rules from the Project at are applied to the Environment. However, to keep thigs flexible, Qovery allows you to override the rules after enviornment creation at the Environment level, in Environment settings.

### Project Rules Configuration

<Steps headingDepth={3}>
<ol>

</p>

</li>

### General

### Mode

Selecting rule mode allows you to: TODO

### Cluster

Selecting the cluster allows you control to which cluster your environments in the project will be deployed to.

**Example use cases**
- deploy your development environments on a cheap cloud provider
- deploy your environments in multiple regions

</p>

### Deployment

### Auto-deploy

**Auto deploy** allows you to control if your applications should be by default automatically updated after receiving new commits.

### Start & Stop

Start and stop section allow you to precisely set up when the environments inside the project should be deployed and cleaned up.

**Example use cases**

- delete your development environments during the weekend
- deploy additional environments during peak hours

### Target Future Environment

This option allows you to specify which environments should be affected by the given deployment rule.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/configuration/deployment/deploy-4.png" alt="Deployments" />
</p>

It takes a regex expression as a parameter and based on that decides which rule should be applied to a newly created environment.

<Alert type="info">

You can override the Rule applied by Project to Environment in Environment settings. Rules configured at the Project level are defaults applied for Environments when they are first created, but you can fine-tune and adjust environments to your needs afterwards.

## Environment Deployment Rules

Setting up Deployment Rules at the Enviornment level allows you to make all necessesary adjustments applied by your default rules from the Project level.

### Environment Rules Configuration

<Steps headingDepth={3}>
<ol>
<li>

Navigate to [Console](https://console-beta.qovery.com)

</li>
<li>

Select your project and environment

</li>
<li>

In environment overview, click **Settings** button:

</p>

</li>

### General

### Mode

Mode settings allow you to override the default Mode rule applied from your Project rules. However, this settings may be only updated when the enviornment is not running.

### Cluster

Cluster settings allow you to override the default Cluster assigned to your enviornment by the Project rules. This settings may be only updated when the enviornment is not running.
