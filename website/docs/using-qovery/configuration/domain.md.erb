## Qovery Domains (default)

Your application is publicly accessible via a Qovery domain as soon as you define it to be publicly accessible in `.qovery.yml` file:

```title=".qovery.yml" {4}
application:
  name: myapp
  project: test
  publicly_accessible: true
```

To get the domain that was assigned to your application, use the CLI:

```
$ qovery status
```

```plain title="OUTPUT"
BRANCHES NAME   STATUS          ENDPOINTS                       APPLICATIONS    DATABASES   BROKERS STORAGE
master          up and running  https://xxx-main-gtw.qovery.io  1               1           0       0

APPLICATIONS NAME   STATUS          ENDPOINTS                       DATABASES   BROKERS STORAGE
simple-example      up and running  https://yyy-xxx-app.qovery.io   1           0       0
```

## Custom Domains

You can use a custom domain name for any of your applications. Additionally, the domain name can be different in each environment (branch).

<Alert type="info">

Currently, if you want to have several domains on a same branch, it is not supported. The workaround is to have a second router.

</Alert>

Here is the overview of the process in order to give you the big picture. Each step is then totally detailed on the next sections.

- Create a Qovery custom domain --> To be done on Qovery
- Retrieve Qovery validation domain  --> To be done on Qovery
- Create CNAME record on the DNS  --> To be done on your DNS provider
- Check verification status of the Qovery custom domain is "live" --> To be done on Qovery side

So basically you do not have to make any complicated configuration on your end, Qovery handles almost everything, except for the CNAME record to create on your DNS provider.

<Steps  headingDepth={3}>

1.   ### Create a Qovery custom domain

    You will have to specify your custom domain in your qovery.yml file:

    ```yaml title=".qovery.yml" {4-6}
    ...
    routers:
    - name: main
      custom_domains:
      - branch: master
        domain: my.domain.tld
      routes:
      - application_name: simple-example-node-with-postgresql
        paths:
        - /
    ```

    Adding the highlighted lines like in the configuration file above exposes your application using your domain. Now commit and push your changes.

    <Alert type="info">

    Do not forget to commit and push your `.qovery.yml` changes to use your domain

    </Alert>

2.   ### Retrieve Qovery validation domain

    In order to see the custom domain you just created, execute the command `qovery domain list` to list all domains of your [environment][docs.environment]:

    ```bash title="List domains"
    qovery domain list
    ```

    ```plain title="OUTPUT"
    BRANCH | DOMAIN                                      | STATUS             | VALIDATION DOMAIN    | ROUTER NAME
    master | my.domain.tld                               | validation pending | xxx-yyy-zzz.acme.com | main
    master | https://main-yenr7erjbs87dk4m-gtw.qovery.io | live               | none                 | my-second-router
    ```

    As you can see, your newly created domain is in status "validation pending".
    In order for it to be live and be able to use it, you have to confirm that it is yours, and create a CNAME record on your DNS provider.
    For this you will need the VALIDATION DOMAIN value, in our case: xxx-yyy-zzz.acme.com.

3.   ### Create CNAME record on the DNS

    Please go to your DNS provider interface and add a `CNAME` record that is targeting the `VALIDATION DOMAIN` - `xxx-yyy-zzz.acme.com` you just retrieved before.

    <Alert type="info">

    If you setup your DNS provider CDN proxy, please ensure the SSL/TLS encryption is end-to-end from client to server through your DNS provider.

    How to do it:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p> Cloudflare: </p>
        <img src='/img/cloudflare-CDN-setup.png' alt='Setup Clouflare SSL/TLS encryption.' />
      </li>
    </ul>

    </Alert>

4.   ### Check verification status of the Qovery custom domain

    After you added the CNAME record on your DNS, it takes Qovery a few minutes to verify and complete the process.
    In order to know if your custom domain is live or not, you  can check the verification status using `qovery domain list`.

    ```bash title="List domains"
    qovery domain list
    ```

    ```plain title="OUTPUT"
    BRANCH | DOMAIN                                      | STATUS             | VALIDATION DOMAIN    | ROUTER NAME
    master | my.domain.tld                               | live               | xxx-yyy-zzz.acme.com | main
    master | https://main-yenr7erjbs87dk4m-gtw.qovery.io | live               | none                 | my-second-router
    ```
    If the status is live, then you are all set!

    Please note that from the Web UI you can find the custom domains associated to your app by going to the Summary tab of the concerned application page.
    They will be listed in the "Custom domains" section:

    <p align="center">
      <img src="/img/application-custom-domains.png" alt="Custom domains list" />
    </p>

</Steps>
