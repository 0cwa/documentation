## Qovery Domains (default)

Your application is publicly accessible via a Qovery domain as soon as you define it to be publicly accessible in `.qovery.yml` file:

```title=".qovery.yml" {4}
application:
  name: myapp
  project: test
  publicly_accessible: true
```

To get the domain that was assigned to your application, use the CLI:

```
$ qovery status
```

```plain title="OUTPUT"
BRANCHES NAME   STATUS          ENDPOINTS                       APPLICATIONS    DATABASES   BROKERS STORAGE 
master          up and running  https://xxx-main-gtw.qovery.io  1               1           0       0       

APPLICATIONS NAME   STATUS          ENDPOINTS                       DATABASES   BROKERS STORAGE 
simple-example      up and running  https://yyy-xxx-app.qovery.io   1           0       0       
```

## Custom Domains

You can use a custom domain name for any of your applications. Additionally, the domain name can be different in each environment.
