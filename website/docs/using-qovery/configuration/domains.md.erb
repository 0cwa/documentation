A DNS (Domain Name System) is automatically generated on deployed applications that you request to be publicly accessible. This allows you to get a simple way to access your application. Also, you get a separate DNS name for each of your branches.

## Qovery DNS (default)

Your application will be publicly accessible via a Qovery domain as soon as you define it to be publicly accessible in `.qovery.yml` file:

```title=".qovery.yml" {4}
application:
  name: myapp
  project: test
  publicly_accessible: true
```

To get the domain that was assigned to your application, use the CLI:

```
$ qovery status
```

```plain title="OUTPUT"
BRANCHES NAME	STATUS        	ENDPOINTS                       APPLICATIONS	DATABASES	BROKERS	STORAGE 
master       	up and running	https://xxx-main-gtw.qovery.io	1           	1        	0      	0      	

APPLICATIONS NAME	STATUS        	ENDPOINTS                    	DATABASES	BROKERS	STORAGE 
simple-example   	up and running	https://yyy-xxx-app.qovery.io	1        	0      	0      	
```

## Custom DNS

You can use a custom domain name for any of your applications.
