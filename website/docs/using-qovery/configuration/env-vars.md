import Alert from '@site/src/components/Alert';

Qovery supports environment variables to make you able to configure your applications.

<Alert type="warning">

Env Vars (environment variables) concept is not directly connected to [Environment][docs.main-concepts.environment] concept.
- **Env Vars**: represent variables you can store and retrieve in your applications
- **Environments**: represent environments (apps, databases and other services) associated with Git branch like `master`, `staging` etc.

## Levels

There are four levels of Env Vars. Each type differs in scope - you can create variables bound to application, environment or project.

| Scope       | Level     | Description     |
|-------------|-----------|-----------------|
| **BUILT_IN**    | 1 | Automatically generated variables based on your configuration (e.g. requested databases) propagated to all projects, environments and applications|
| **PROJECT**     | 2 | Variables at the project level are shared across all environments and all applications of the project|
| **ENVIRONMENT** | 3 | Variables at the environment level are shared across all applications of the project in one, given environment |
| **APPLICATION** | 4 | Variables available for one application in one environment |

<Alert>

You can override variables - the highest level variable win (e.g. `PROJECT` variable can override `BUILT_IN` variable).

</Alert>

## Built-in variables
By default, every environment will have those variables:


## Built-in variables naming convention
For any added service (database, broker, storage), your application will get additional built-in variables. These can be used, for example, to connect
to the database.

We follow this naming convention:

```
QOVERY_<SERVICE_TYPE>_<NAME>_<SPEC>
```

To demonstrate this, let's take a quick look on a simple database example:

```yml title=".qovery.yml" {1,5}
application:
  ...
databases:
- type: postgresql
  version: "10.10"
  name: my-pg
```
