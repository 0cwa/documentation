import Alert from '@site/src/components/Alert';

Qovery supports environment variables to make you able to configure your applications.

<Alert type="warning">

Env Vars (environment variables) concept is not directly connected to [Environment][docs.main-concepts.environment] concept.
- **Env Vars**: represent variables you can store and retrieve in your applications
- **Environments**: represent environments (apps, databases and other services) associated with Git branch like `master`, `staging` etc.

## Levels

There are four levels of Env Vars. Each type differs in scope - you can create variables bound to application, environment or project.

| Scope       | Level     | Description     |
|-------------|-----------|-----------------|
| **BUILT_IN**    | 1 | Automatically generated variables based on your configuration (e.g. requested databases) propagated to all projects, environments and applications|
| **PROJECT**     | 2 | Variables at the project level are shared across all environments and all applications of the project|
| **ENVIRONMENT** | 3 | Variables at the environment level are shared across all applications of the project in one, given environment |
| **APPLICATION** | 4 | Variables available for one application in one environment |

<Alert>

You can override variables - the highest level variable win (e.g. `PROJECT` variable can override `BUILT_IN` variable).

</Alert>

## Built-in variables
By default, every environment will have those variables:

| Name       | Example     | Description     |
|-------------|-----------|-----------------|
| **QOVEY_JSON_B64**    | - | Contains all environment variables accessible by your application encoded as Base64 JSON |
| **QOVERY_BRANCH_NAME**     | master | Git branch name |
| **QOVERY_IS_PRODUCTION** | true | Flag that indicates production environment |

## Additional built-in variables

For any added service (database, broker, storage), your application will receive additional built-in variables. These can be used, for example, to connect
to the database.

**Naming Convention**:

We use the following naming convention for additional built-in variables:

```
QOVERY_<SERVICE_TYPE>_<NAME>_<SPEC>
```

To demonstrate this, let's take a quick look on a simple database example:

```yml title=".qovery.yml" {3-6}
application:
  ...
databases:
- type: postgresql
  version: "10.10"
  name: my-pg
```

Adding a database like in the example above results in adding the following environment variables to your application:

| Name       | Example     | Description    |
|-------------|-----------|-----------------|
| QOVERY_**DATABASE_MY_PG_NAME**    | my-postgresql | Name of your PostgreSQL database |
| QOVERY_**DATABASE_MY_PG_HOST**     | host.amazonaws.com | PostgreSQL host address |
| QOVERY_**DATABASE_MY_PG_USERNAME** | username | PostgreSQL username |
| QOVERY_**DATABASE_MY_PG_PASSWORD** | password | PostgreSQL password |
| ... | ... | ... |

## Adding custom Env Vars

Adding environment variables with the CLI is very simple:

```bash
qovery project env add ENV_NAME ENV_VALUE
qovery environment env add ENV_NAME ENV_VALUE
qovery application env add ENV_NAME ENV_VALUE
```

<Alert>

When you add Env Vars using the CLI, you also specify the scope of given variable, e.g.

```bash {2}
qovery project env add ENV_NAME ENV_VALUE
qovery environment env add ENV_NAME ENV_VALUE
qovery application env add ENV_NAME ENV_VALUE
```

The highlighted command adds a variable with `environment` scope.

</Alert>

<Alert type="danger"> 

Qovery CLI is aware of your current directory and Git branch. Be sure you are in correct application directory and Git branch (environment) before executing Qovery Env Vars commands

</Alert>

## Listing Env Vars

You can list environment variables of given application with single CLI command;

```bash
qovery application env list
```

```plain title="OUTPUT"
SCOPE        KEY                                                   VALUE
BUILT_IN     QOVERY_BRANCH_NAME                                    feature_a
BUILT_IN     QOVERY_IS_PRODUCTION                                  false
BUILT_IN     QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_POSTGRESQL_3498225_PASSWORD        xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
BUILT_IN     QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_POSTGRESQL_3498225_USERNAME        superuser
BUILT_IN     QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_POSTGRESQL_3498225_PORT            5432
BUILT_IN     QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_POSTGRESQL_3498225_FQDN            your.fqdn.id.rds.amazonaws.com
BUILT_IN     QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_POSTGRESQL_3498225_HOST            your.host.id.rds.amazonaws.com
BUILT_IN     QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_POSTGRESQL_3498225_CONNECTION_URI  postgresql://user:pass@your.fqdn.id.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/postgres
BUILT_IN     QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_POSTGRESQL_3498225_VERSION         11.5
BUILT_IN     QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_POSTGRESQL_3498225_TYPE            POSTGRESQL
BUILT_IN     QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_POSTGRESQL_3498225_NAME            my-postgresql-id
PROJECT      my_custom_project_env                                 my_project_value
ENVIRONMENT  DRY_RUN                                               true
APPLICATION  enable_feature_a                                      true
```

Analogically to adding environment variables, while listing Env Vars you also choose the scope of variables to list:

```bash
qovery application env list
qovery project env list
qovery environment env list
```

## Deleting Env Vars

To delete an environment variable of application scope, run:

```
qovery application env delete MY_ENV_NAME
```

<Alert> 

You can not delete `BUILT_IN` variables, but you can override them!

</Alert>

## Overriding Env Vars

As described in the levels' section, you can override existing variables. To do so, just add a new Env Vars with higher level (e.g. add an `APPLICATION` level variable to override `PROJECT` variable for given application).

## Env Var aliases
You can create an alias for existing environment variable.

For example: your application requires a `DATABASE_PASSWORD` variable. Qovery provides your application with `QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_POSTGRESQL_3498225_PASSWORD` variable with database password.
Instead of copy-pasting its value, you can create an alias to `QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_POSTGRESQL_3498225_PASSWORD`.

```bash
qovery application env add DATABASE_PASSWORD '$QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_POSTGRESQL_3498225_PASSWORD'
```

After executing the above command, your application can use `DATABASE_PASSWORD` variable to get database password.

The syntax for aliasing is:

```bash
... add NEW_VARIABLE_NAME `$OLD_VARIABLE_NAME`
```
