Qovery supports environment variables to make you able to configure your applications.

<Alert type="warning">

Env Vars (environment variables) concept is not directly connected to [Environment concept][docs.main-concepts.environment].
- Env Vars: represents variables you can store and retrieve in your applications
- Environment: is the environment (apps, databases and other services) associated with Git branch like `master`, `staging` etc.

</Alert>

## Levels

There are four levels of Env Vars. Each type differs in scope - you can create variables bound to one application, environment or project.

| Scope       | Level     | Description     |
|-------------|-----------|-----------------|
| BUILT_IN    | 1 | Automatically generated variables based on your configuration and will be propagated to all projects, environments and applications|
| PROJECT     | 2 | Env Vars at the project level are shared across all environments and all applications of the project|
| ENVIRONMENT | 3 | Env Vars at the environment level are shared across all applications of the project in one, given environment |
| Application | 4 | Env Variables available for one application in one environment |

<Alert>
You can override variables - the highest level variable win (application level variable can override any other variable from other levels).
