<Assumptions name="documentation">

You have created a [Project][docs.using-qovery.configuration.project].

</Assumptions>

An **Environment** is a group of [applications][docs.using-qovery.configuration.application] and [databases][docs.using-qovery.configuration.database] running within the same namespace. A [Project][docs.using-qovery.configuration.project] can have multiple **Environments**.

<Alert type="info">

Applications and databases from an Environment are isolated from other Environments.

</Alert>

## Create an environment

The first time you create a project, you need to add your first environment manually.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/environment_create.png" alt="Create an environment" />
</p>

Give a name to your environment that is easily recognizable by anyone from your team.

<Alert type="info">

It is good practice to use `production`, `main` or `master`, `staging`, `dev`, `fix/xxx`, `feat/xxx`, depending on the purpose of your environment.

</Alert>

When you start using Qovery heavily, your environment list can look like this

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/environment_list.png" alt="List of environments" />
</p>

An Environment can be automatically created when you create Pull Requests, and Git Branches. [See the Deployment Rule section](#deployment-rules) below.

## Edit environment general settings

General settings of an environment can be updated in the settings panel. Your can access to it by clicking on the `SETTINGS` button.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/env-setting-button.png" alt="Environment settings button" />
</p>

On the `General` tab, you will be able to update your environment name. It will also display the environment mode and the cluster assigned to your environment.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/env-setting-panel.png" alt="Environment settings button" />
</p>

<Alert type="info">

Please note that environment type and associated cluster are not editable after the environment was provisioned.

Refer to the [Types of environment](#types-of-environment) section below to learn more about environment modes.

</Alert>

## Preview environment

> Use Preview Environment to get early feedback on your application changes.

The purpose of an Environment is to manage a bunch of applications that are working all together. Your production environment runs 24/7, where your other environments may not need to run all day long. E.g. you may need to run Environments to get early feedback on your application changes before the changes are merged into production. This is what we call **Preview Environment**.

<Alert type="info">

Sometimes **Preview Environment** are also known as **Ephemeral Environment**, **Temporary Environment**, **Development Environment**.

</Alert>

Creating a **Preview Environment** is similar to create a casual Environment.

## Build and Deployment logs

Sometimes, you need to have a closer look on what is going on while an operation (see [statuses](#environment-statuses) below) is in progress.

<div class="video-container">
  <p align="center">
    <iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/245b2e7e72d548a6b412899df94e7223" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen>
    </iframe>
  </p>
</div>

Click on the `show logs` button to watch your deployment logs in real-time.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/environment_deployment_logs.jpg" alt="Environment deployment logs" />
</p>

## Clone environment

Cloning an environment is possible if you want to create an Environment from another one.


<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/environment_actions_dropdown.jpg" alt="Environment actions dropdown" />
</p>

Environment clone is convenient for those use cases:
- Make a demo without impacting the original Environment.
- Validating a feature that needs to reflect the original Environment.

## Update an Environment

<Steps headingDepth={3}>
<ol>
<li>

Navigate to [Console][urls.qovery_console]

</li>
<li>

Choose your environment

</li>
<li>

In the environment overview, click on the `Actions` button and `Update all`.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/configuration/application/update-all.png" alt="Application" />
</p>

</li>
<li>

Once you click, this pannel will appear and you will be able to select the environments you wish to update.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/configuration/application/update-all2.png" alt="Application" />
</p>

</li>
</ol>
</Steps>

## Types of environment

Two modes are possible for an Environment - `production` and `development`. The difference between the `production` and `development` modes are the permissions. [Read more][docs.using-qovery.configuration.organization#roles].

| mode | description |
|------|-------------|
| production | this environment mode protects from destructive actions and get access to sensitive information - only possible by an admin |
| development | this environment mode makes it easy to destroy an environment - possible by an admin and developer |

To know more about the permissions - go to the [Organization configuration][docs.using-qovery.configuration.organization#roles].

Here is the mode you should set depending on your Environment.

| environment type | recommended mode | why |
|-------------|------------------|-----|
| production | production | Production environment should not be stopped or deleted by anyone - so to protect it we recommend using `production` mode |
| staging | production | Staging environment reflects how things work and is sometimes as critical as production for companies. Using `production` mode is then recommended. |
| feature | development | Feature environment is a working environment that could be stopped and deleted by anyone. It is not "business critical" and can be set in `development` mode. |
| fix | development | Fix environment is similar to a Feature environment. It is not "business critical" and can be set in `development` mode. |

## Advanced features

It is possible to go beyond than the basic configuration for an Environment. Here is a list of advanced features available for your environments.

### Auto-Deploy environment

Auto-Deploy environment feature allows you to control if your applications should be, by default, automatically updated after receiving new commits. This feature is part of the [Environment deployment rules][docs.using-qovery.configuration.deployment-rule] feature.

### Auto-delete environment

Auto-delete environment feature allows you to control if your applications should be, by default, automatically deleted after branch merging or deletion. This feature is part of the [Environment deployment rules][docs.using-qovery.configuration.deployment-rule] feature.

## Environment statuses

An Environment is a machine-state. Here is a list of the different statuses that your Environment can get.

<Alert type="info">

To get more details on what is going on - check out your environment [deployment logs](#build-and-deployment-logs).

</Alert>

| state | description |
|--------|-------------|
| READY | Your environment has been initialized and is ready to received its first applications |
| QUEUED | A deployment task has been received and your environment is about deploying it. The task has been queued and can take some times to be processed. |
| BUILDING | The build of one or several application(s) of your environment is in progress |
| BUILD_ERROR | Something goes wrong during the build of your applications or databases |
| BUILT | One or several application(s) of your environment are built |
| DEPLOYING | The deployment of one or several application(s) of your environment is in progress |
| DEPLOYMENT_ERROR | Something goes wrong during the deployment of your applications or databases |
| DEPLOYED | One or several application(s) of your environment are deployed |
| STOPPING | The shutdown of one or several application(s) of your environment is in progress |
| STOP_ERROR | Something goes wrong during the shutdown of your applications or databases |
| STOPPED | One or several application(s) of your environment are stopped |
| DELETING | The deletion of one or several application(s) of your environment is in progress |
| DELETE_ERROR | Something goes wrong during the deletion of your applications or databases |
| DELETED | One or several application(s) of your environment are deleted |
| RUNNING | Your applications and databases are running |
| RUNNING_ERROR | Something goes wrong during the run of your applications |

## Deployment rules

The **Deployment Rules** lets you configure the lifecycle of your [Environments][docs.using-qovery.configuration.environment].

<Alert type="info">

Using **Deployment Rules** is a good practice to reduce your cost up to 60%.

</Alert>

Refer to the [Deployment Rule][docs.using-qovery.configuration.deployment-rule] documentation to know more.

## Deployments history

You can easily access to the deployments history of your environment by clicking on deployment `history button` in `Action` menu.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/deployment-history-access.png" alt="Deployment history button access" />
</p>

This page allows you to view the history of all previous deployments of your environment and their status. By clicking on the extension button, you will also be able to view the services deployed in the environment and their deployment status.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/deployment-history.png" alt="Deployment history list" />
</p>

## Delete an environment

<Alert type="danger">

This is a non-recoverable operation. By deleting your environment, all your running applications and data within the environment are deleted.

</Alert>

To delete your environment, you must go in the `settings` > `Danger zone` and delete your Environment.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/env-danger-zone.png" alt="Environment danger zone" />
</p>
