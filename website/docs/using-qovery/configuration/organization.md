## Create an Organization

You need to create an organization the first time you use Qovery. You have to choose between the **Free**, **Professional**, **Business** and **Enterprise**.

</p>

### How to choose between plans?

In a nutshell:

- **Free**, **Professional**, **Business** and **Enterprise** plans: to deploy on your Cloud account.
- **Community**: to get free hosting for your hobby project.

Get more info [here][urls.qovery_pricing].

## Manage your clusters

With Qovery, you can manage multiple clusters in your organizations settings and deploy your project environments and services on the one you want. 

In the settings of your organization, you will be able to add, stop, update the settings and delete a cluster.

</p>

Check out [this documentation][docs.using-qovery.configuration.cloud-service-provider] according to the Cloud service provider that you want
to use.

#### What is the default cluster? 

The default cluster is the first cluster you installed in your organization. 

When you create a new environment and you leave the `mode` and `cluster` parameters set to the value `Automatic`, it will be targeted by one of your project rules. However, if no project rules target them, they will be deployed on the default cluster. 

Check out [this documentation][docs.using-qovery.configuration.project] to learn more about the deployment rules. 

## Organization members

You can invite someone to join your organization by email. Then he will get access to your projects and will be able to contribute.
