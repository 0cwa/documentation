## Getting started

<Assumptions>

* You have a [Qovery][docs.using-qovery.interface] account

</Assumptions>

### Create an Organization

To create an Organization you need to use the [web interface][docs.using-qovery.interface.web-interface] and click on the top right, you'll
have the button "create an organization".

</p>

### Link your app to a project within an Organization

To assign an application to a project within an organization, put the corresponding `organization` name, and the `project` name in
the `.qovery.yml`:

```yaml title=".qovery.yml" {2}
application:
  organization: my-organization
  project: project-x
  name: my-application
  publicly_accessible: true
routers:
- name: main
  routes:
  - application_name: my-application
    paths:
    - /
```

This configuration deploys the application in `my-project` project, within `my-organization` organization.

## Organization members

### Invite people

You can invite someone by email, and a group of people by using the domain email.
