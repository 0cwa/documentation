import Alert from '@site/src/components/Alert';

Qovery is available in a number of different Regions. Each region is a self-contained copy of Qovery in a single datacenter. When you first create an [environment][docs.environment] you can specify which region it should be in.

<Alert type="info">

Each environment can be assigned to a different region

## Configuration

To specify the region you want to use you need to modify your `.qovery.yml`

```yaml title=".qovery.yml" {4}
application:
  name: jhipster-sample-app
  project: jhipster-sample-app
  cloud_region: aws/us-west-2
  publicly_accessible: true
routers:
  - name: main
    routes:
      - application_name: jhipster-sample-app
        paths:
          - /*
```

The format used is `{cloud_provider}/{cloud_provider_sregion}`

If you use a non supported region you will have an error from the linter:

```bash title="non-existing region"
ERROR:   aws/fake-region is not a valid region
SOLUTION: Valid cloud regions: aws/us-east-2, aws/us-west-2, aws/eu-west-3

Total errors found: 1
```

## FAQ

### How to choose a region?

Different datacenters are located in different geographic areas, and you may want to keep your site physically close to the bulk of your user base for reduced latency.

### I don't find a region that is provided by a Cloud provider

We are probably testing the support of this region, please [contact us][urls.qovery_contact_us] to know what's the status

### Migrate between regions

You can't migrate an environment from one region to another after it is created.
