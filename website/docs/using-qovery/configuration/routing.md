Qovery allows you to define the routes used in your [environments][docs.environment].

A route describes how an incoming HTTP request is going to be processed by Qovery. The routes are defined using .qovery.yml file in your application repository.

## Concepts

### Router
Qovery has the concept of "[router][docs.routing]" which is where the traffic transit from the World and your application.
Each application that needs to be accessible from outside - needs to be attached to at least one router.

An application can be attached to 0 to n routers. It's up to you and depends on your use case.

A router is defined by:
* a name (must be unique through the project)
* 0 to n custom domains
* 1 to n routes

Here is a configuration example of a router:

```yaml title=".qovery.yml" {6-15}
application:
  name: my-app-1
  project: my-project
  publicly_accessible: true
  port: 8080
routers:
- name: main
  custom_domains:
  - branch: master
    domain: my.tld.com
  routes:
  - application_name: my-app-1
    paths:
    - /
```

### Route
A "[route][docs.routing]" is a concept to connect a "router" to an application. An application can have 0 to n routes.

A route is defined by:
* a path
* an application name

Here is a configuration example of a route:

```yaml title=".qovery.yml" {11-15}
application:
  name: my-app-1
  project: my-project
  publicly_accessible: true
  port: 8080
routers:
- name: main
  custom_domains:
  - branch: master
    domain: my.tld.com
  routes:
  - application_name: my-app-1
    paths:
    - /
```

### Multiple routes
As explained above, each router can have multiple routes targeting different applications.
**Each application can use the same router by using the same router name within the same project.**

Here is an example with two applications, which each of them have their own `.qovery.yml` file.

```yaml title="Application 1 - .qovery.yml"
application:
  name: my-app-1
  project: my-project
  publicly_accessible: true
  port: 8080
routers:
- name: main
  custom_domains:
  - branch: master
    domain: my.tld.com
  routes:
  - application_name: my-app-1
    paths:
    - /
```

```yaml title="Application 2 - .qovery.yml"
application:
  name: my-app-2
  project: my-project
  publicly_accessible: true
  port: 8080
routers:
- name: main
  custom_domains:
  - branch: master
    domain: my.tld.com
  routes:
  - application_name: my-app-2
    paths:
    - /app2/
```

Behind the scene Qovery will merge the two .qovery.yml into a single one. Which gives a router that will look like this:

```yaml title="Merged router" {8-13}
...
routers:
- name: main
  custom_domains:
  - branch: master
    domain: my.tld.com
  routes:
  - application_name: my-app-1
    paths:
    - /
  - application_name: my-app-2
    paths:
    - /app2/
```

Meaning, traffic with a route starting with the URL `https://my.tld.com/app2` is routed on `my-app-2`, and the remaining traffic is routed on `my-app-1`.

<Alert type="info">

Qovery takes care of duplicated routes and deny the latest created one to avoid unintended overrides.

</Alert>

### Custom domains
A custom domain can be attached (optional) to a "router" and an [environment][docs.environment]. Then, multiple application can benefit from the same domain.

<Alert type="success">

Every router on Qovery automatically gets a free `qovery.io` address which does not change per branch.
