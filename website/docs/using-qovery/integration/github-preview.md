**Github Preview** allow you to quickly see your latest changes on an automatically deployed environment before merging your pull request.
You don't have to do anything - simply use Github as you would normally do. All useful information will appear automatically
in Github's user interface.

Github Previews allow you to make the best use of Qovery deployments without even leaving Github UI. Qovery makes sure
that all information you need appear next to your commits in your pull requests.

This feature allows you to focus completely on developing your application instead of learning and using additional tools.
Write your feature, push the code, open a pull request and see everything you need in one place.

of your application which you can use for tests before merging the pull request.
