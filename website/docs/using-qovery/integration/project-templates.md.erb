Templates are pre-configured `Dockerfiles` and `.qovery.yml` configs that allow you to bootstrap a new application quickly.

## Template

### List

You can list all available templates with the command:

```bash
$ qovery template list
```
```bash title="All templates available"
NAME   | DESCRIPTION
hasura | Hasura is a production-ready GraphQL backend
gatsby | Gatsby is a fast modern site generator for React
...
```

### Use

To use one of them, run:

```bash
mkdir my_hasura_application
cd my_hasura_application
git init

qovery init -t hasura
```

<CodeExplanation>

* The mkdir command creates a new directory for your application
* The cd command moves you to your newly created directory
* The git init command initializes a new Git repository in the current directory
* The qovery init command configures Hasura

</CodeExplanation>

## Contributions

Any idea of a new template? [Contributions are welcomed][urls.qovery_templates_repo].

## Final word

Now, all you have to do is to commit and publish your repository to Github, Gitlab, or Bitbucket, to deploy your application!
