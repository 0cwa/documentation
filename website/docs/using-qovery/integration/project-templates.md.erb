Templates are pre-configured `Dockerfiles` and `.qovery.yml` configs that allow you to bootstrap a new application using one of the most popular technologies quickly.

## Template

### Use

To use one of them, run:

```bash
qovery init
```

The command will redirect you to the interactive web user interface where you can choose the type of template you want to use.

## Contributions

Any idea of a new template? [Contributions are welcomed][urls.qovery_templates_repo].
