Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with [Terraform][docs.devops.infrastructure-as-code.terraform] and our [REST API][docs.devops.infrastructure-as-code.rest-api] to manage Qovery and deploy your apps.

</Alert>

Qovery provides a very easy to use CLI (Command Line Interface) designed to fit the developer workflow perfectly.

----

The purpose of the CLI is to integrate seamlessly with your development workflow:

1. Write code
2. Commit
3. **Qovery** - deploy a new version of your application
4. **Qovery CLI** - check the status of your application
5. **Qovery CLI** - debug your application
6. Repeat

## Context

Context command lets you configure the CLI to work with your chosen application. Before executing other commands, you need first to set up the context.
The context is then remembered and used by the CLI. You can configure a new context anytime by running the `qovery context set` command.

### Set New Context

To set a new context, type `qovery context set`:

```bash
$ qovery context set
Qovery: Current context:
Organization | Qovery
Project      | test
Environment  | development
Application  | website

Qovery: Select new context
Organization:
✔ Qovery
Project:
✔ admin
Environment:
✔ main
Application:
✔ app

Qovery: New context:
Organization | Qovery
Project      | admin
Environment  | main
Application  | app
```

### Print Current Context

```bash
$ qovery context
Qovery: Current context:
Organization | Qovery
Project      | admin
Environment  | main
Application  | app

Qovery: You can set a new context using 'qovery context set'.
```

## Log

Log command allows you to display the application logs.

```bash
$ qovery log
  TIME                    MESSAGE
  Jul 15 08:46:13.019717       at /usr/src/app/autoFunctions/levels.js:17:16
  Jul 15 08:46:13.019721       at Array.forEach (<anonymous>)
  Jul 15 08:46:13.019724       at Timeout._onTimeout (/usr/src/app/autoFunctions/levels.js:15:14)
  Jul 15 08:46:13.019728       at listOnTimeout (internal/timers.js:557:17)
  # ... the rest of logs
```

By default, the last 1000 logs is displayed.

### Follow Logs

To make the CLI follow your logs, use `-f` flag:

```bash
$ qovery log -f
  TIME                    MESSAGE
  Jul 15 08:46:13.019717       at /usr/src/app/autoFunctions/levels.js:17:16
  Jul 15 08:46:13.019721       at Array.forEach (<anonymous>)
  Jul 15 08:46:13.019724       at Timeout._onTimeout (/usr/src/app/autoFunctions/levels.js:15:14)
  Jul 15 08:46:13.019728       at listOnTimeout (internal/timers.js:557:17)
  # ... the rest of logs
```

This will make the CLI follow your application logs and append any new logs till you use `CTRL+C`.

## Status

Status command lets you print the basic status of your application.

```bash
$ qovery status
15 Jul 21 10:55 CEST
Application | Backend
Status      | RUNNING
```

## Console

Console command quickly opens the Qovery Console in your browser to let you display more information about your application.

```bash
$ qovery console
Qovery: Opening https://console.qovery.com/platform/organization/your-org/projects/your-proj/environments/your-env/applications/your-app/summary
```
