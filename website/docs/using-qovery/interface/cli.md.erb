import Alert from '@site/src/components/Alert';

Qovery provides a very easy to use CLI (Command Line Interface) designed to perfectly fit the developer workflow.

<Alert type="warning">

When you type a command, the CLI is aware of your current [project][docs.project], [application][docs.application] and [environment][docs.environment]. Which is very convenient!

</Alert>

## First usage

<%= qovery_sign_up() %>

### Help

You can see all the commands available by executing:

```bash
$ qovery help
```

```bash title="Help output"
The qovery command line interface lets you manage your Qovery environment.

Usage:
  qovery [command]

Available Commands:
  application Perform application actions
  auth        Do authentication
  database    Perform database actions
  deploy      Perform deploy actions
  domain      Perform domain actions

  template    Perform templating actions
  upgrade     Upgrade Qovery CLI to latest version

Use "qovery [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

## Limitations

### Windows

**ANSI Color codes**: *Powershell* does not natively support ANSI color codes. [Some tricks exist to make it work](https://stackoverflow.com/a/51681675/560638).
The more accessible it is to use `qovery <command> | Out-Host` when you need to show colors.
