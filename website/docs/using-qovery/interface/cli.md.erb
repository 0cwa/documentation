import Alert from '@site/src/components/Alert';

Qovery provides a very easy to use CLI (Command Line Interface) designed to perfectly fit the developer workflow.

<Alert type="warning">

When you type a command, the CLI is aware of your current [organization][docs.using-qovery.configuration.organization], [project][docs.using-qovery.configuration.project], [application][docs.using-qovery.configuration.application] and [environment][docs.using-qovery.configuration.environment]. Which is very convenient!

</Alert>

```

## Limitations

### Windows

**ANSI Color codes**: *Powershell* does not natively support ANSI color codes. [Some tricks exist to make it work](https://stackoverflow.com/a/51681675/560638).
The more accessible it is to use `qovery <command> | Out-Host` when you need to show colors.
