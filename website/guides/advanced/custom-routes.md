Qovery allows you to define the routes used in your [environments][docs.environment].

A route describes how an incoming HTTP request is going to be processed by Qovery. The routes are defined using .qovery.yml file in your application repository.

<Alert type="info">

No network knowledge is required to create your custom routes

</Alert>

<Assumptions>

* You have installed the [Qovery CLI][guides.deploy-your-first-application]
* You have deployed at least 2 applications with Qovery

</Assumptions>

## FAQ
Before digging deeper into this guide, I would explain why you should not or why you should use it.

### Why you should use it
* You need to expose your application publicly through HTTPS
* You need to have one endpoint (foo.com) targeting multiple backend applications

### Why you should not use it
* You only have one application within your [environment][docs.environment]
* You are not sure why you should use it ([ask us][urls.qovery_chat])

## Concepts

### Router
Qovery has the concept of "[router][docs.routing]" which is where the traffic transit from the World and your application.
Each application that needs to be accessible from outside - needs to be attached to at least one router.

An application can be attached to 0 to n routers. It's up to you and depends on your use case.

A router is defined by:
* a name (must be unique through the project)
* 0 to n custom domains
* 1 to n routes

Here is a configuration example of a router:

```yaml title=".qovery.yml" {7-15}
application:
  name: my-app-1
  project: my-project
  cloud_region: aws/us-west-2
  publicly_accessible: true
routers:
- name: main
  custom_domains:
  - branch: master
    domain: my.tld.com
  routes:
  - application_name: my-app-1
    paths:
    - /
```

### Route
A "[route][docs.routing]" is a concept to connect a "router" to an application. An application can have 0 to n routes.

A route is defined by:
* a path
* an application name

Here is a configuration example of a route:

```yaml title=".qovery.yml" {12-15}
application:
  name: my-app-1
  project: my-project
  cloud_region: aws/us-west-2
  publicly_accessible: true
routers:
- name: main
  custom_domains:
  - branch: master
    domain: my.tld.com
  routes:
  - application_name: my-app-1
    paths:
    - /
```

### Multiple routes
As explained above, each router can have multiple routes targeting different applications.
**Each application can use the same router by using the same router name within the same project.**

Here is an example with two applications, which each of them have their own `.qovery.yml` file.

```yaml title="Application 1 - .qovery.yml"
application:
  name: my-app-1
  project: my-project
  cloud_region: aws/us-west-2
  publicly_accessible: true
routers:
- name: main
  custom_domains:
  - branch: master
    domain: my.tld.com
  routes:
  - application_name: my-app-1
    paths:
    - /
```

```yaml title="Application 2 - .qovery.yml"
application:
  name: my-app-2
  project: my-project
  cloud_region: aws/us-west-2
  publicly_accessible: true
routers:
- name: main
  custom_domains:
  - branch: master
    domain: my.tld.com
  routes:
  - application_name: my-app-2
    paths:
    - /app2/
```

Behind the scene Qovery will merge the two .qovery.yml into a single one. Which gives a router that will look like this:

```yaml title="Merged router" {8-13}
...
routers:
- name: main
  custom_domains:
  - branch: master
    domain: my.tld.com
  routes:
  - application_name: my-app-1
    paths:
    - /
  - application_name: my-app-2
    paths:
    - /app2/
```

Meaning, traffic with a route starting with the URL `https://my.tld.com/app2` is routed on `my-app-2`, and the remaining traffic is routed on `my-app-1`.

<Alert type="info">

Qovery takes care of duplicated routes and deny the latest created one to avoid unintended overrides.

</Alert>

### Custom domains
A custom domain can be attached (optional) to a "router" and an [environment][docs.environment]. Then, multiple application can benefit from the same domain.

<Alert type="success">

Every router on Qovery automatically gets a free `qovery.io` address which does not change per branch.
