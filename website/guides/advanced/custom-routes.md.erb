<Alert type="info">

No network knowledge is required to create your custom routes

</Alert>

<Assumptions>

* You have installed the [Qovery CLI][guides.deploy-your-first-application]
* You need to deploy more than one application (e.g backend and frontend)

</Assumptions>

## FAQ
Before digging deeper into this guide, I would explain why you should not or why you should use it.

### Why you should use it
* You need to expose your application publicly through HTTPS
* You need to have one endpoint (foo.com) targeting multiple backend applications

### Why you should not use it
* You only have one application within your [environment][docs.environment]
* You are not sure why you should use it ([ask us][urls.qovery_chat])

## Concepts

# Example
Here is a concrete example to show how custom routes could be your best friend in a real-world application.

## The e-commerce website
Let's imagine that we have to build an e-commerce website which gives the possibility to order shoes. This website must be able to take orders and provide an invoice for each order. Our system has one web interface, one order service, and one billing service that is for each of them an independent application.

What do we want?
* The **web interface** must be available through **shopping.com** and **www.shopping.com**
* The **order** service must be available through **api.shopping.com/order**
* The **billing** service must be available through **api.shopping.com/billing** as well
* The traffic coming on `api.shopping.com` and not covered by the two rules above must be routed on **order**

This is what the custom routing definition looks like for each of them

### Web interface
Here is what the `.qovery.yml` looks like for the web interface:

```yaml title=".qovery.yml web interface" {7-16}
application:
  name: web-interface
  project: my-ecommerce-project
  publicly_accessible: true
routers:
- name: frontend
  custom_domains:
  - branch: master
    domain: shopping.com
  - branch: master
    domain: www.shopping.com
  routes:
  - application_name: web-interface
    paths:
    - /
```

### Order service
Here is what the `.qovery.yml` looks like for the order service:

```yaml title=".qovery.yml order service" {7-16}
application:
  name: order-service
  project: my-ecommerce-project
  publicly_accessible: true
routers:
- name: backend
  custom_domains:
  - branch: master
    domain: api.shopping.com
  routes:
  - application_name: order-service
    paths:
    - /
    - /order/
```

### Billing service
Here is what the `.qovery.yml` looks like for the billing service:

```yaml title=".qovery.yml billing service" {7-15}
application:
  name: billing-service
  project: my-ecommerce-project
  publicly_accessible: true
routers:
- name: backend
  custom_domains:
  - branch: master
    domain: api.shopping.com
  routes:
  - application_name: billing-service
    paths:
    - /billing/
```

At the end, `api.shopping.com`, `shopping.com` and `www.shopping.com` work as expected.
Happy custom routing.
