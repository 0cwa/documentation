import Steps from '@site/src/components/Steps';

A well designed application can run in multiple environments. 
Its configuration is not hard-coded in the source code, but instead extracted and allowed to be adjustable appropriately for different situations.
Although apps run the same code, they may use different, environment-specific configuration. 

For example, your application may use a different instance of database on your machine than in a production environment (thus, database credentials and addresses should be configurable).

For this reason, Qovery allows you to store your configurations and credentials securely using `Environment Variables`.

## Set variables

Let's first create a new Node.js application that uses environment variables.

<Steps  headingDepth={3}>


1.   In an empty directory, create `.qovery.yml` - Qovery configuration file with the following content:

     ```yml title=".qovery.yml"
     application:
       name: node-app
       project: environment-variables-demo
       cloud_region: aws/eu-west-3
       publicly_accessible: true
     routers:
     - name: main
       routes:
       - application_name: node-app
         paths:
         - /*
     ```

2.  Create `app.js` file - a simple Node.js HTTP server application:

    ```javascript title="app.js" {6,11}
    const http = require('http');

    const hostname = '0.0.0.0';
    const port = 3333;

    const MY_MESSAGE = process.env.MY_MESSAGE

    const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
      res.statusCode = 200;
      res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
      res.end(MY_MESSAGE);
    });

    server.listen(port, hostname, () => {
      console.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);
    });
    ```

    As you see, in the first highlighted line the app uses process.env.`MY_MESSAGE` environment variable to set a value of a property in the application.
    Then, in the second highlighted line, the application sends the value of previously set property back to the user that hits the server.

3.  And the last step to finish our application - create a `Dockerfile` with the following content:

    ```dockerfile title="Dockerfile"
    FROM node
    COPY app.js .
    EXPOSE 3333
    CMD [ "node", "app.js" ]
    ```

</Steps>

Now, initialize a Git repository in this directory and publish it to your Github. After it's done, your app should be deployed quickly:

```bash title="Check app status"
qovery status
```

```plain title="OUTPUT"
BRANCH NAME | STATUS  | ENDPOINTS                                   | APPLICATIONS | DATABASES  
master      | running | https://main-im6qagd2nmnrfqax-gtw.qovery.io | node-app     | none       

APPLICATION NAME | STATUS  | ENDPOINT | DATABASES  
node-app         | running |          | none       
```

When you hit the application endpoint (using `curl` or your browser), you'll see an empty response:

```bash title="Invoke application endpoint"
$ curl https://main-im6qagd2nmnrfqax-gtw.qovery.io
```

```bash title="OUTPUT"
```

Why is that? That's because... we did not set `MY_MESSAGE` environment variable that we use in our application.

Let's fix it quickly. Run:

```bash title="Add MY_MESSQGE variable"
qovery application env add MY_MESSAGE "Hello World from Qovery!"
```

Now, our variable is set. To check it:

```bash title="List env variables"
qovery application env list
```

```title="OUTPUT"
  SCOPE       | KEY                                  | VALUE                     
  BUILT_IN    | QOVERY_JSON_B64                      | <base64>                  
  BUILT_IN    | QOVERY_BRANCH_NAME                   | master                    
  BUILT_IN    | QOVERY_IS_PRODUCTION                 | true                      
  BUILT_IN    | QOVERY_APPLICATION_NODE_APP_HOSTNAME | <hidden>                  
  APPLICATION | MY_MESSAGE                           | Hello World from Qovery!  
```

After adding a new variable, we have to restart our application to make it able to read the new configuration:

```bash title="Redeploy an application"
qovery redeploy
```

Your application should be back up shortly after redeployment. You can track the status using `qovery status` command. After it's running again, test the app's endpoint:

```bash title="Invoke application endpoint"
$ curl https://main-im6qagd2nmnrfqax-gtw.qovery.io
```

```bash title="OUTPUT"
Hello World from Qovery!
```

Great! The env variable was read by the application correctly and returned to the user.

## Configure database

Now, we would like to use a database in our application. How to get its connection data, like connection URI, password, and username?

Let's first add a database to our app:

```yml title=".qovery.yml" {6-9}
application:
  name: node-app
  project: environment-variables-demo
  cloud_region: aws/eu-west-3
  publicly_accessible: true
databases:
- type: mongodb
  version: "3.6"
  name: my-mongo
routers:
- name: main
  routes:
  - application_name: node-app
    paths:
    - /*
```

Add the highlighted part to your Qovery config, commit and push. Voila! In a few minutes, our MongoDB instance is available to the application. To track this process, run `qovery status`.

After the database is deployed, we need to know a few details about it to use it in the application.

To get the details, run `qovery application env list` one more time:

```title="OUTPUT"
SCOPE       | KEY                                                         | VALUE                     
BUILT_IN    | QOVERY_JSON_B64                                             | <base64>                  
BUILT_IN    | QOVERY_BRANCH_NAME                                          | master                    
BUILT_IN    | QOVERY_IS_PRODUCTION                                        | true                      
BUILT_IN    | QOVERY_APPLICATION_NODE_APP_HOSTNAME                        | <hidden>                  
BUILT_IN    | QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_MONGO_DATABASE                           |                           
BUILT_IN    | QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_MONGO_PASSWORD                           | <hidden>                  
BUILT_IN    | QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_MONGO_USERNAME                           | <hidden>                  
BUILT_IN    | QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_MONGO_PORT                               | <hidden>                  
BUILT_IN    | QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_MONGO_FQDN                               | <hidden>                  
BUILT_IN    | QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_MONGO_HOST                               | <hidden>                  
BUILT_IN    | QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_MONGO_CONNECTION_URI_WITHOUT_CREDENTIALS | <hidden>                  
BUILT_IN    | QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_MONGO_CONNECTION_URI                     | <hidden>                  
BUILT_IN    | QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_MONGO_VERSION                            | 3.6                       
BUILT_IN    | QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_MONGO_TYPE                               | MONGODB                   
BUILT_IN    | QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_MONGO_NAME                               | my-mongo                  
APPLICATION | MY_MESSAGE                                                  | Hello World from Qovery!  
```

Adding a new database resulted in new environment variables available for the application! To display hidden values, add `-c` flag to the command -> `qovery application env list -c`.

Now, we could just read `QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_MONGO_CONNECTION_URI` env variable in our app to get the connection URI to MongoDB. This approach would work and is completely fine, but what if we have chosen a different name for database URI?
If we need a value of one of `BUILT_IN` variables (like Qovery database credentials), but we want to use our own env variable names like, for example, `MONGO_URI`, then we can create an alias.

Let's see it in action:

```bash title="Create variable alias"
qovery application env add MONGO_URI '$QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_MONGO_CONNECTION_URI'
```

After running the command from above, we should see a new env variable added with the value of `QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_MONGO_CONNECTION_URI`:

```bash title="List variables"
qovery application env list
```

```bash title="OUTPUT"
SCOPE       | KEY                                                         | VALUE                     
BUILT_IN    | QOVERY_JSON_B64                                             | <base64>                  
BUILT_IN    | QOVERY_BRANCH_NAME                                          | master                    
BUILT_IN    | QOVERY_IS_PRODUCTION                                        | true                      
BUILT_IN    | QOVERY_APPLICATION_NODE_APP_HOSTNAME                        | <hidden>                  
BUILT_IN    | QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_MONGO_DATABASE                           |                           
BUILT_IN    | QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_MONGO_PASSWORD                           | <hidden>                  
BUILT_IN    | QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_MONGO_USERNAME                           | <hidden>                  
BUILT_IN    | QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_MONGO_PORT                               | <hidden>                  
BUILT_IN    | QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_MONGO_FQDN                               | <hidden>                  
BUILT_IN    | QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_MONGO_HOST                               | <hidden>                  
BUILT_IN    | QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_MONGO_CONNECTION_URI_WITHOUT_CREDENTIALS | <hidden>                  
BUILT_IN    | QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_MONGO_CONNECTION_URI                     | <hidden>                  
BUILT_IN    | QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_MONGO_VERSION                            | 3.6                       
BUILT_IN    | QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_MONGO_TYPE                               | MONGODB                   
BUILT_IN    | QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_MONGO_NAME                               | my-mongo                  
APPLICATION | MONGO_URI                                                   | <hidden>                  
APPLICATION | MY_MESSAGE                                                  | Hello World from Qovery! 
```

Above, you can see that the env was added. Run the same command with `-c` flag to see that its value is in fact the same as `QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_MONGO_CONNECTION_URI`.

Now, we can use `MONGO_URI` environment variable to connect our application to MongoDB!

## Update variable

What if we would like to change the message our app returns to the user? To change the value of `MY_MESSAGE` env variable, simply run:

```bash title="Update variable"
qovery application env add MY_MESSAGE "Completely new message!"
```

Adding env variable with the same name shadows previously set value.

## Deleting variable

If for some reason you would like to delete variable completely, you can run:

```bash title="Delete variable"
qovery application env delete MY_MESSAGE
```

That's all; it's gone.

## Scopes of variables

So far, we have used just one branch (environment) and only one env variable scope (`application` scope).

To see what it means, run:

```bash title="Create a new branch"
git checkout -b another_branch
git push --set-upstream origin another_branch
```

Now, as we use a different Git branch, we are in a different environment.

Run `qovery application env list`. What do you see? Env variables we set previously are gone. That's because they were bound to the `application` scope.

On Qovery, we have a few levels of environment variables. `BUILT_IN` variables are automatically created and injected by Qovery.
`APPLICATION` variables are bound to *single application in one environment* (Git branch). `ENVIRONMENT` scope variables are bound to the environment,
so they're accessible by all applications in a given environment. The last scope - `PROJECT` scope - makes a given variable accessible everywhere (all apps, all environments).

To select the scope of variables that you are adding/removing/listing, use the CLI as follows:

```bash title="Env variables scopes"
qovery application env list
qovery project env list
qovery environment env list
```

The general pattern of this command is `qovery SCOPE env COMMAND`.
