Your application is running, but something goes wrong? In this guide, you'll learn how to debug your application and solve your problem to make it running smoothly.

<Assumptions>

* You have installed the [Qovery CLI][guides.deploy-your-first-application]
* You have already deployed an application with Qovery

</Assumptions>

## Debugging an application build
You have deployed your application with Qovery, and the status of your application is `build error`. Meaning, your application has failed to build correctly.
There are two commands for getting a closer look at what's going on.

### Qovery status
The command `qovery status` give the status of our application. In the case of a build error, the reason is displayed into the console as well

```bash
$ qovery status
```

```bash title="Build error output" {10-23}
BRANCH NAME | STATUS      | ENDPOINTS                                   | APPLICATIONS                        | DATABASES
master      | build error | https://main-yenr7erjbs87dk4m-gtw.qovery.io | simple-example-node-with-postgresql | my-postgresql-3498225

APPLICATION NAME                    | STATUS      | DATABASES
simple-example-node-with-postgresql | build error | my-postgresql-3498225

DATABASE NAME         | STATUS  | TYPE       | VERSION | ENDPOINT | PORT     | USERNAME | PASSWORD | APPLICATIONS
my-postgresql-3498225 | running | POSTGRESQL | 11.5    | <hidden> | <hidden> | <hidden> | <hidden> | simple-example-node-with-postgresql

Something goes wrong:

---------- Start of error message ----------
Sending build context to Docker daemon  244.7kB
Step 1/8 : FROM node:13-alpine
---> bcfeabd22749
Step 2/8 : RUN mkdir -p /usr/src/app
---> Using cache
---> 104f4613b141
Step 3/8 : RUN toto
---> Running in 52fa3e66f0c4
/bin/sh: toto: not found
The command '/bin/sh -c toto' returned a non-zero code: 127
----------- End of error message -----------

HINT: Ensure your Dockerfile is correct. Run and test your container locally with 'qovery run'
```

Here we can see that the build error comes from our Dockerfile. We also have a hint affirming this problem.

### Qovery run

<Alert type="info">

You must have the [docker][urls.docker] runtime installed and running

</Alert>

The command `qovery run` is a wrapper around the commands `docker build` and `docker run`. It's the best way to test your container locally. Our motto is, if your application is running locally with `qovery run` then it will work on Qovery.
In the case of a bad Dockerfile, by running `qovery run` we directly see the error

```bash
$ qovery run
```

```bash title="Build error output"
2020/04/22 10:12:37 reload master environment: DONE
Step 1/8 : FROM node:13-alpine
 ---> e1495e4ac50d
Step 2/8 : RUN mkdir -p /usr/src/app
 ---> Using cache
 ---> 3afe9d6678e0
Step 3/8 : RUN toto
 ---> Running in fadf25b6fc5e
/bin/sh: toto: not found
```

## Debugging a running application
Your application is running, but for some reason, it is not working as expected. Here are a few tips to find out what's going on.

### Qovery status
First, check that all your applications and services are up and running correctly with `qovery status`

```bash
$ qovery status
```

```bash title="Check application status"
BRANCH NAME | STATUS  | ENDPOINTS                                   | APPLICATIONS                        | DATABASES
master      | running | https://main-yenr7erjbs87dk4m-gtw.qovery.io | simple-example-node-with-postgresql | my-postgresql-3498225

APPLICATION NAME                    | STATUS  | DATABASES
simple-example-node-with-postgresql | running | my-postgresql-3498225

DATABASE NAME         | STATUS  | TYPE       | VERSION | ENDPOINT | PORT     | USERNAME | PASSWORD | APPLICATIONS
my-postgresql-3498225 | running | POSTGRESQL | 11.5    | <hidden> | <hidden> | <hidden> | <hidden> | simple-example-node-with-postgresql
```

Everything is fine here, meaning the problem is on our side as developer.

### Qovery log
Your application is running, and logs are debug/info/warning/error messages can be thrown upon the standard output. To show them it's as easy as typing one command

```bash
$ qovery log
```

```bash title="Log output"
GET / 200 7.707 ms - 170
GET / 200 5.572 ms - 170
GET / 200 5.296 ms - 170
GET /stylesheets/style.css 200 2.812 ms - 117
GET /favicon.ico 404 8.127 ms - 913
GET /stylesheets/style.css 304 0.861 ms - -
GET / 304 5.100 ms - -
GET /stylesheets/style.css 304 0.361 ms - -
GET / 200 5.055 ms - 170
```

<Alert type="info">

See all log options with `qovery log -h`

</Alert>

**Pro tip**: you can even follow the output with the `-f` option

```bash
$ qovery log -f
```

If you want to display logs of all applications in a given environment, use `qovery env log` instead:

```bash
$ qovery env log
log-printer-gitlab | 2020-11-24T12:00:24.826Z

```

### Rollback
You need more time to fix a bug? No worries, you can rollback at any time by using `qovery deploy <commit id>`

```bash
$ qovery deploy list
```

```bash title="Last deployed commits"
BRANCH | COMMIT DATE                     | COMMIT ID                                | COMMIT AUTHOR     | DEPLOYED

To rollback on the commit `8cf3e8aec44b2468e59eca59defe164eea10c63f` it's as easy as executing the command

```bash
$ qovery deploy 8cf3e8aec44b2468e59eca59defe164eea10c63f
```

```bash title="Rollback output"
deployment in progress...
Hint: type "qovery status --watch" to track the progression of this deployment
```

Then, we can watch the progress of the rollback with

```bash
$ qovery status --watch
```

```bash title="Deployment progression"
 100% |████████████████████████████████████████|  [0s:0s]

Your environment is ready!

```

Well done! You have rollback to a previous working version.

## Monitoring and alerting

Qovery will provide [very soon][urls.qovery_roadmap] monitoring and alerting. In the meantime, we highly recommend using tools like [Datadog][urls.datadog].

## Third-party integration
Qovery integrates third-party services like Datadog, NewRelic, and others. You can use any third service that you want if they support containers (which is the case of most of them).
