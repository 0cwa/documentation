Qovery is a straightforward way to deploy any application. In this guide, we'll deploy a Hello World [Node.JS][urls.node_js] application and touch on some basic concepts.

<Assumptions>

* You have a [Github][urls.github] account

### Hello World!

<Alert type="warning">

[Qovery needs to get access to your Github account][urls.authorize_qovery] to deploy the application.

</Alert>

**Fork** this [NodeJS application](https://github.com/Qovery/simple-example-node), and clone the repository:

```bash
# Clone the sample application
$ git clone git@github.com:Qovery/simple-example-node.git
```

Qovery has deployed the application, to get the deployment status:

```bash
# Move into the directory
$ cd simple-example-node

# Show the deployment status
$ qovery status
```

Here is the output you should have. Is it not the case? [Contact us on Discord][urls.qovery_chat]

```bash
BRANCH NAME | STATUS  | ENDPOINTS          | APPLICATIONS        | DATABASES
master      | running | https://domain.tld | simple-example-node | none

APPLICATION NAME    | STATUS  | DATABASES
simple-example-node | running | none
```

Voil√† ! Your first application has been successfully deployed
