Qovery is an easy way to deploy complete backend and frontend applications. In this guide, we'll deploy a Hello World [Node.JS][urls.node_js] application and touch on some basic concepts.

<Assumptions>

* You have a [Github][urls.github] account

</Assumptions>

<li>

### Hello World!

<Alert type="warning">

[Qovery needs to get access to your Github account][urls.authorize_qovery] to deploy the application.

</Alert>

**Fork** this [NodeJS application](https://github.com/Qovery/simple-example-node), and **Clone** your repository

```bash title="Clone your forked application"
# Change <your_name> with your Github account name
$ git clone git@github.com:<your_name>/simple-example-node.git
```

Qovery has deployed the application, to get the deployment status:

```bash
# Move into the directory
$ cd simple-example-node

# Show the deployment status
$ qovery status
```

Here is the output you should have. Is it not the case? [Contact us on Discord][urls.qovery_chat]

```bash
BRANCH NAME | STATUS  | ENDPOINTS          | APPLICATIONS        | DATABASES
master      | running | https://domain.tld | simple-example-node | none

APPLICATION NAME    | STATUS  | DATABASES
simple-example-node | running | none
```

Voil√† ! Your first application has been successfully deployed


</li>
</ol>
</Steps>

## Deploy your own application

<Alert type="info">

You must provide your `Dockerfile` **OR** use [one provided by us][guides.application-template]

</Alert>

Deploying your existing application is as easy as running `qovery init` at the root of your project directory.

```bash
$ qovery init
```
<CodeExplanation>

* `qovery init` is an interactive command to generate the final `.qovery.yml`.
* It must be run at the root of your project directory.
* You must version your application with Git.

</CodeExplanation>

Then, **commit** and **push** your code

```bash
$ git add .qovery.yml Dockerfile
$ git commit -m "add: .qovery.yml and Dockerfile to deploy on Qovery"
$ git push -u origin master
```

That's it!

## Next Steps

To deploy your application, it's as simple as that. In the following article, we will see how to add a database. Let's get started!
