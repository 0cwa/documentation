Metrics are an _essential_ part of observing any
service; without them you are flying blind. But collecting and analyzing them
can be a real challenge -- especially at scale. Not only do you need to solve
the basic task of collecting your metrics, but you must do it
in a reliable, performant, and robust manner. Nothing is more frustrating than
having your metrics pipeline fall on it's face during an
outage, or even worse, disrupt more important services!

Fear not! In this guide we'll show you how to send send metrics to [InfluxDB][urls.influxdb]
and build a metrics pipeline that will be the backbone of
your observability strategy.

## Background

### What is InfluxDB Metrics?

[InfluxDB][urls.influxdb] is an open-source time series database developed by InfluxData. It is written in Go and optimized for fast, high-availability storage and retrieval of time series data in fields such as operations monitoring, application metrics, Internet of Things sensor data, and real-time analytics.

## Strategy

### How This Guide Works

We'll be using [Qovery][urls.qovery_website] to accomplish this task. Qovery
is a [popular][urls.qovery_stars] [open-source][urls.qovery_repo] utility for
building observability pipelines. It's written in [Rust][urls.rust], making it
lightweight, [ultra-fast][urls.qovery_performance] and highly reliable. And
we'll be deploying Qovery as a
[daemon][docs.strategies#daemon].

The [daemon deployment strategy][docs.strategies#daemon] is designed for data
collection on a single host. Qovery runs in the background, in its own process,
collecting _all_ data for that host.
Typically data is collected from a process manager, such as Journald via
Qovery's [`journald` source][docs.sources.journald], but can be collected
through any of Qovery's [sources][docs.sources].
The following diagram demonstrates how it works.

### What We'll Accomplish

To be clear, here's everything we'll accomplish in this short guide:

<ol className="list--checks list--flush">
  <li>
    Collect your metrics from one or more sources
  </li>
  <li>
    Send metrics to InfluxDB v1 or v2.
    <ol>
      <li>Batch data to maximize throughput.</li>
      <li>Automatically retry failed requests, with backoff.</li>
      <li>Automatically aggregate metrics at the edge for improved performance.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li className="list--li--arrow list--li--pink text--bold">All in just a few minutes!</li>
</ol>

## Next Steps

Qovery is _powerful_ utility and we're just scratching the surface in this
guide. Here are a few pages we recommend that demonstrate the power and
flexibility of Qovery:
