[AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) (Amazon Web Services) is an amazing and reliable cloud service provider. AWS, like Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure, provides everything you need to host an application without having to worry about running the underlying servers and network configuration. Everything you need to quickly begin hosting is provided as a packaged services.

However, deploying an application on AWS presents some challenges. The typical deployment workflow looks like this: write code, push it to Git, compile code, deploy code, validate your changes and repeat. Developers thus not only have to do all of this manually, but they also have to configure tons of services (VPC, database, cache, DNS, CDN, etc.) to make their application live on the web.

[Qovery](https://www.qovery.com/) was created to solve this problem. In this blog post, I will show you how Qovery improves the developer experience to deploy staging and production [Laravel](https://www.laravel.com/) application with [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) database on AWS. You will be able to focus on writing the best code instead of managing complex services.

<Assumptions name="guide">

* Your Operating System is MacOS / Windows / Linux
* You have a Github account

</Assumptions>

## Sign up

<%= qovery_sign_up() %>


## Optional: Get the Laravel sample application

Get a local copy of the [Laravel sample project](https://github.com/Qovery/docker-simple-example-laravel) by forking the project using your Github account and by executing the following command:

<Alert>
Do not forget to fork the project and change the URL below with yours
</Alert>

```bash
git clone -b tutorial git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/docker-simple-example-laravel.git
```

## Deploy the Laravel application

TODO CHANGE

## Bonuses
### Test the Laravel application locally

The Qovery motto is: if your application runs locally, then your application will run on Qovery. To test if your application is running locally, execute the following command:

<Alert>
The Docker runtime is required
</Alert>

```bash
$ qovery run
```

```bash
...
Starting server
AH00558: apache2: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using 172.17.0.2. Set the 'ServerName' directive globally to suppress this message

```

Navigate to http://localhost:80 through your web browser and you should see a JSON response
Note: `qovery run` connects your application to the MySQL database on AWS.

### Deploy the application on a staging environment
Qovery has a very powerful feature known as “environment”. Qovery supports the deployment of isolated development environments from your branches, complete with exact copies of all of your data. This is useful for testing changes in isolation before merging them.

So, do you want to create a new feature, fix a bug or make a modification without impacting the production or any other important environment? Type the following commands:

```bash
$ git checkout -b feat_foo
$ git push -u origin feat_foo
$ qovery status
```

Output

```bash
------------+---------+---------------------------------------------+--------------+-----------+---------+----------
  feat_foo    | running | https://ym3en0t3jm3j4xxx-main-gtw.qovery.io | 1            | 1         | 0       | 0

  APPLICATION NAME              | STATUS  | ENDPOINT                                                | DATABASES | BROKERS | STORAGE
--------------------------------+---------+---------------------------------------------------------+-----------+---------+----------
  docker-simple-example-laravel | running | https://ee5laucsynk35unj-ym3en0t3jm3j4xxx-app.qovery.io | 1         | 0       | 0

  DATABASE NAME    | STATUS  | TYPE  | VERSION | ENDPOINT | PORT     | USERNAME | PASSWORD | APPLICATIONS
-------------------+---------+-------+---------+----------+----------+----------+----------+--------------------------------
  my-mysql-6132005 | running | MYSQL | 8.0     |  hidden  |  hidden  |  hidden  |  hidden  | docker-simple-example-laravel
```

## Conclusion
Qovery and AWS together bring to developers the full power of simplicity and flexibility while deploying applications. Any developer can now take advantage of AWS in seconds instead of days.
