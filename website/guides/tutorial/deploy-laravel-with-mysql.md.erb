[AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) (Amazon Web Services) is a fantastic and reliable cloud service provider. AWS, like Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure, provides everything you need to host an application without having to worry about running the underlying servers and network configuration.

However, deploying an application on AWS presents some challenges. The typical deployment workflow looks like this: write code, push it to Git, compile code, deploy code, validate your changes, and repeat. Developers thus not only have to do all of this manually, but they also have to configure tons of services (VPC, database, cache, DNS, CDN, etc.) to make their application live on the web.

[Qovery](https://www.qovery.com/) solve this problem. In this blog post, I will show you how Qovery improves the developer experience to deploy staging and production [Laravel](https://www.laravel.com/) application with [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) database on AWS. You will be able to focus on writing the best code instead of managing complex services.

<Assumptions name="guide">

* Your Operating System is MacOS / Windows / Linux
* You have a Github account

</Assumptions>

## Sign up

<%= qovery_sign_up() %>


## Optional: Get the Laravel sample application

Get a local copy of the [Laravel sample project](https://github.com/Qovery/docker-simple-example-laravel) by forking the project using your Github account and by executing the following command:

<Alert>
Do not forget to fork the project and change the URL below with yours
</Alert>

```bash
$ git clone -b tutorial git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/docker-simple-example-laravel.git
```

## Deploy the Laravel application

To deploy the Laravel application connected to a MySQL database, you need to have a .qovery.yml file, and a `Dockerfile` (already provided) at the root of your project. This file indicates the external resources (e.g. MySQL) that your application needs to work correctly.

To create the `.qovery.yml` file, run the following command:‍‍

```bash
$ qovery init
```

The `.qovery.yml` file is created at the root of the project directory

```bash
$ cat .qovery.yml
```

Output

```bash
application:
  name: docker-simple-example-laravel
  project: my-laravel-app-cloud
  cloud_region: aws/eu-west-3
  publicly_accessible: true
databases:
- type: mysql
  version: "8.0"
  name: my-mysql-6132005
routers:
- name: main
  routes:
  - application_name: docker-simple-example-laravel
    paths:
    - /
```

<Alert>
Qovery supports multiple databases (eg. PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, Memcached, Cassandra), brokers (eg. RabbitMQ, Kafka) and storage services (eg. S3).
</Alert>

[Authorize the Qovery Github application to get access to your Github account](https://github.com/apps/qovery/installations/new). Once done, you need to commit and push the `.qovery.yml` and `Dockerfile` file to deploy your app.

```bash
$ git add .qovery.yml Dockerfile
$ git commit -m “add .qovery.yml and Dockerfile”
$ git push -u origin qovery
```

Voila! Qovery is now deploying your app!

See the deployment status by executing

```bash
$ qovery status
```
Output

```bash
------------+---------+---------------------------------------------+--------------+-----------+---------+----------
  qovery      | running | https://ym3en0t3jm3j4wqq-main-gtw.qovery.io | 1            | 1         | 0       | 0

  APPLICATION NAME              | STATUS  | ENDPOINT                                                | DATABASES | BROKERS | STORAGE
--------------------------------+---------+---------------------------------------------------------+-----------+---------+----------
  docker-simple-example-laravel | running | https://ee5laucsynk35unj-ym3en0t3jm3j4wqq-app.qovery.io | 1         | 0       | 0

  DATABASE NAME    | STATUS  | TYPE  | VERSION | ENDPOINT | PORT     | USERNAME | PASSWORD | APPLICATIONS

```

## Bonuses
### Test the Laravel application locally

The Qovery motto is: if your application runs locally, then your application will run on Qovery. To test if your application is running locally, execute the following command:

<Alert>
The Docker runtime is required
</Alert>

```bash
$ qovery run
```

```bash
...
Starting server
AH00558: apache2: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using 172.17.0.2. Set the 'ServerName' directive globally to suppress this message

```

Note: `qovery run` connects your application to the MySQL database on AWS.

### Deploy the application on a staging environment
Qovery has a compelling feature known as “environment”. Qovery supports the deployment of isolated development environments from your branches, complete with exact copies of all of your data. The Environment is useful for testing changes in isolation before merging them.

So, do you want to create a new feature, fix a bug, or make modifications without impacting the production or any other important environment? Type the following commands:

```bash
$ git checkout -b feat_foo
$ git push -u origin feat_foo
$ qovery status
```

Output

```bash
------------+---------+---------------------------------------------+--------------+-----------+---------+----------
  feat_foo    | running | https://ym3en0t3jm3j4xxx-main-gtw.qovery.io | 1            | 1         | 0       | 0

  APPLICATION NAME              | STATUS  | ENDPOINT                                                | DATABASES | BROKERS | STORAGE
--------------------------------+---------+---------------------------------------------------------+-----------+---------+----------
  docker-simple-example-laravel | running | https://ee5laucsynk35unj-ym3en0t3jm3j4xxx-app.qovery.io | 1         | 0       | 0

  DATABASE NAME    | STATUS  | TYPE  | VERSION | ENDPOINT | PORT     | USERNAME | PASSWORD | APPLICATIONS
-------------------+---------+-------+---------+----------+----------+----------+----------+--------------------------------
  my-mysql-6132005 | running | MYSQL | 8.0     |  hidden  |  hidden  |  hidden  |  hidden  | docker-simple-example-laravel
```
