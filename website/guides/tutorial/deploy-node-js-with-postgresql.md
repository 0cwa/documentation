[AWS][urls.aws] (Amazon Web Services) is a fantastic and reliable cloud service provider. AWS, like [GCP][urls.gcp] (Google Cloud Platform) and Microsoft [Azure][urls.azure], provides everything you need to host an application without having to worry about running the underlying servers and network configuration.

However, deploying an application on any of those cloud providers presents many challenges. The typical deployment workflow looks like this: write code, push it to Git repository, compile code, deploy code, validate your changes, and repeat. Developers not only have to take care of all of this by themselves, but they also have to configure tons of services (like VPCs, databases, caches, DNS, CDN, and others) to make their application live on the web.

Qovery solves this problem by combining the reliability of AWS and the simplicity of Heroku to augment the developer experience.

In this blog post, I will show you how Qovery improves developers' workflows by deploying staging and production [NodeJS][urls.node_js] application with [PostgreSQL][urls.postgresql] database on Qovery. You will be able to focus on writing the best code and delivering business value instead of managing complex services.

  className={"rounded"}
  defaultValue={"linux"}
  placeholder="Select your OS"
  select={false}
  size={null}
  values={[{"group":"Platforms","label":"Linux","value":"linux"},{"group":"Platforms","label":"MacOS","value":"macos"},{"group":"Platforms","label":"Windows","value":"windows"}]}>

<TabItem value="linux">

```bash
# Download and install Qovery CLI on every Linux distribution
$ curl -s https://get.qovery.com | sudo bash
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="macos">

<Tabs
  centered={true}
  className="rounded"
  defaultValue="homebrew"
  values={[{"label":"Homebrew","value":"homebrew"},{"label":"Manual","value":"manual"}]}>

<TabItem value="homebrew">

The common solution to install a command line binary on the MacOS is to use [Homebrew][urls.brew].

```bash
# Add Qovery brew repository
$ brew tap Qovery/qovery-cli

# Install the CLI
$ brew install qovery-cli
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="manual">

```bash
# Install the Qovery CLI on MacOS manually
$ curl -s https://get.qovery.com | bash
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="windows">

<Tabs
  centered={true}
  className="rounded"
  defaultValue="scoop"
  values={[{"label":"Scoop","value":"scoop"},{"label":"Manual","value":"manual"}]}>

<TabItem value="scoop">

The classic way to install binaries on Windows is to use [Scoop][urls.scoop].

```bash
# Add Qovery bucket
$ scoop bucket add qovery https://github.com/Qovery/scoop-qovery-cli

# Install the CLI
$ scoop install qovery-cli
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="manual">

Install the Qovery CLI on Windows manually by downloading the [latest realease][urls.qovery_cli_releases], and uncompress its content to
`C:\Windows`.

Congratulations, you are logged-in.

## Deployment

### NodeJS sample application
Get a local copy of the [NodeJS sample project][urls.sample_node_js_with_postgresql] by forking it.

### Configure your project
To deploy your NodeJS application connected to a PostgreSQL, you need to have a `.qovery.yml` file, and a `Dockerfile` (both provided in the sample project) at the root of your project.

<Alert>
The .qovery.yml file describes all the dependencies that your application needs (e.g., PostgreSQL) to work smoothly
</Alert>

In this example we are using PostgreSQL v11.5

After forking the sample application, you can check the content of `.qovery.yml`:

```bash
$ cat .qovery.yml
```

```yaml title=".qovery.yml"
application:
  name: my-application
  project: my-project
  cloud_region: aws/us-west-2
  publicly_accessible: true
databases:
- type: postgresql
  version: "11.5"
  name: my-db
routers:
- name: main
  routes:
  - application_name: my-application
    paths:
    - /
```

[Authorize the Qovery Github application][urls.authorize_qovery] to get access to your Github account. Once done, all new commits you push to your forked repository will trigger new deployments of the application.

### Connect your application to PostgreSQL
Credentials of your database are available via environment variables. Qovery injects environment vars at the runtime.
To list all the environment variables available to your application, execute

```bash
# List all environment variables
$ qovery project env list
```

```bash title="Output"
SCOPE    | KEY                                                      | VALUE
BUILT_IN | QOVERY_JSON_B64                                          | <base64>
BUILT_IN | QOVERY_BRANCH_NAME                                       | master
BUILT_IN | QOVERY_IS_PRODUCTION                                     | true
BUILT_IN | QOVERY_MY_APPLICATION_HOSTNAME                           | <hidden>
BUILT_IN | QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_DB_DATABASE                           | <hidden>
BUILT_IN | QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_DB_PASSWORD                           | <hidden>
BUILT_IN | QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_DB_USERNAME                           | <hidden>
BUILT_IN | QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_DB_PORT                               | <hidden>
BUILT_IN | QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_DB_FQDN                               | <hidden>
BUILT_IN | QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_DB_HOST                               | <hidden>
BUILT_IN | QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_DB_CONNECTION_URI_WITHOUT_CREDENTIALS | <hidden>
BUILT_IN | QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_DB_CONNECTION_URI                     | <hidden>
BUILT_IN | QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_DB_VERSION                            | 11.5
BUILT_IN | QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_DB_TYPE                               | PostgreSQL
BUILT_IN | QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_DB_NAME                               | my-db
```

The sample application is preconfigured to use those environment variables to connect to the database.

Forking the application with `.qovery.yml` and a `Dockerfile` should trigger app deployment.

See the deployment status by executing:

```bash
# Show your deployment status
$ qovery status
```

```bash title="Output"
BRANCH NAME | STATUS  | ENDPOINTS                                   | APPLICATIONS    | DATABASES
master      | running | https://main-abcdefgh12345678-gtw.qovery.io | my-application  | my-db

APPLICATION NAME  | STATUS  | DATABASES
my-application    | running | my-db

DATABASE NAME    | STATUS  | TYPE       | VERSION | ENDPOINT | PORT     | USERNAME | PASSWORD | APPLICATIONS
my-db            | running | POSTGRESQL      | 11.5     | <hidden> | <hidden> | <hidden> | <hidden> | my-application
```

When your application `status` is `running`, you can use a browser or `curl` to access its endpoints.

## Trigger a new deployment

Now, you can play with the sample application and commit & push your changes. Qovery detects your actions and triggers new builds and application deployments. Any change you make will be reflected in your deployed application automatically.

## Bonuses (optional)
### Test the NodeJS application locally
The Qovery motto is: if your application runs locally, it runs well on Qovery, too. To test if your application is running locally, execute the following command:

<Alert>
The Docker runtime is required
</Alert>

```bash
$ qovery run
```

Note: `qovery run` connects your application to the PostgreSQL database on Qovery.

### Deploy the application on a staging environment
Qovery has a compelling feature known as "environments". Qovery supports the deployment of isolated development environments that reflect your Git branches. Environments are complete copies of all of your data, application, and services like databases. The Environment is useful for testing changes in isolation before merging them to your main branch.

So, do you want to create a new feature, fix a bug, or make modifications without impacting the production or any other important environment? Type the following commands:

```bash
$ git checkout -b feat_foo
$ git push -u origin feat_foo

# show deployment status
$ qovery status
```

```bash title="Output"
BRANCH NAME | STATUS  | ENDPOINTS                                   | APPLICATIONS    | DATABASES
feat_foo    | running | https://main-yenr7erjbs87dk4m-gtw.qovery.io | my-application  | my-db

APPLICATION NAME      | STATUS  | DATABASES
docker-simple-example | running | my-db

DATABASE NAME  | STATUS  | TYPE       | VERSION | ENDPOINT | PORT     | USERNAME | PASSWORD | APPLICATIONS
my-db          | running | PostgreSQL      | 11.5     | <hidden> | <hidden> | <hidden> | <hidden> | my-application
```
