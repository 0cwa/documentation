While releasing the [latest major update of Qovery](https://www.qovery.com/blog/one-week-before-the-launch-of-qovery-v2-beta-whats-new#open-api), we realized that we need to open our API to our users in order to make them able to
build integrations and customizations they need in their development workflows. This month, we launched a BETA version of the Qovery V2 platform, and alongside this, we [made our beta API open](https://api-doc.qovery.com/) and ready to play with and experiment.

## Integration

To integrate with the new API, one has a choice of reading the documentation and doing all the necessary plumbing by himself. However, at Qovery, we value developer experience, so we decided to make this process easier and more streamlined.

### Generating API client code

Our API specification is made in a way that makes it very easy to generate API clients in [any of the many supported languages](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator#overview). We also prepared a script to make this process seamless - all you need to do is to clone our open API repository and run one command to generate the newest client version.

### Steps

<Assumptions name="guide">

* You have installed [Node/NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* You have installed [Open API Generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator#17---npm)

</Assumptions>

<Steps headingDepth={3}>

<ol>

<li>

#### Clone the repository

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Qovery/qovery-openapi-spec.git
$ cd qovery-openapi-spec
```

</li>

<li>

#### Generate the client code

```bash
$ npm run generate -- $LANGUAGE
```

where: **$LANGUAGE** is the [language of your choice](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator#overview).

</li>

<li>

#### List the generated files

```bash
$ ls out/client
```

This folder contains all the files necessary to interact with [Qovery API](https://api-doc.qovery.com/), as well as its documentation. To use it in your project, you can create a repository to store the client files and then import them as a dependency in your project. This part is highly dependant on the language and technology you are using, so it's not covered in this post.

</li>

</ol>

</Steps>

### Under the hood

The `npm run generate -- $LANGUAGE` command under the hood uses the [open-api-generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator) and a [Open API specification](https://swagger.io/specification/) created to define Qovery API.
You can see the specification after cloning [our open api repository](https://github.com/Qovery/qovery-openapi-spec) and running `npm run build` in `_build/openapi.yaml` file.

The clients are generated using the [open-api-generator](https://github/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator) and the specification file - `_build/openapi.yaml`.

### Example

As an example of generated API client, let's use the [Qovery CLI](https://github.com/Qovery/qovery-cli). The [command-line interface](https://hub.qovery.com/docs/using-qovery/interface/cli/) of Qovery is using a [Go API Client](https://github.com/Qovery/qovery-client-go) that was generated following the steps from this article.
After generating the client, we simply published the `out/client` folder as a [Git Repository](https://github.com/Qovery/qovery-client-go) and then simply imported the code in the CLI application as a dependency:

```go
package utils

import (
    "github.com/qovery/qovery-client-go"
)
```

This allowed us to use the generated client code to interact with [Qovery API](https://api-doc.qovery.com/) very easily:

```go
token, err := GetAccessToken()
if err != nil {
    return err
}

auth := context.WithValue(context.Background(), qovery.ContextAccessToken, string(token))
client := qovery.NewAPIClient(qovery.NewConfiguration())

organizations, res, err := client.OrganizationMainCallsApi.ListOrganization(auth).Execute()
if err != nil {
    return err
}
if res.StatusCode >= 400 {
    return errors.New("Received " + res.Status + " response while listing organizations. ")
}
```

## Summary

[Qovery Open API specification](https://github.com/Qovery/qovery-openapi-spec.git) allows creating [Qovery API](https://api-doc.qovery.com/) stubs extremely quickly. At Qovery, we officially support only [Golang Client](https://github.com/Qovery/qovery-client-go), but if you use a different language, you can generate your own client in a matter of seconds following the steps of this article.
