In recent years, *Docker* has been becoming more and more popular tool used to deploy web applications. [According to Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/docker-adoption/) in 2018, the adoption of Docker in large organizations reached about 47 percent and almost 20 percent in small organizations. This report it two years old - no doubt Docker is even more common now. 

In my opinion, knowing Docker basics is an essential tool in the toolbox of every software engineer, especially in the web development ecosystem. In this article, I'll demonstrate the easiest way to Dockerize and deploy a simple application. Before we dive deep into practical steps, let's first answer two essential questions - "What is Docker" and "Why should I use it" in the first place.

## Docker in a nutshell

Docker is a tool that makes it easy to build and deploy your applications, typically to the cloud environment. It allows you to package your application in a container that contains your app with all of the things it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies. Then, this package can be run on any machine with a Docker engine installed, no matter the underlying configuration or system distribution.

## Why should I use Docker?

`It works on my machine` sentence has become a meme in the software world. You can even get a sticker on your laptop:

<img src="/img/it-works-on-my-machine.jpg" alt="It works - on my machine!" />

Making applications run consistently in various environments is one of the issues addressed very well by Docker. 

Docker makes sure that your containerized applications run in the same way on your machine, on your friend's machine, and on the AWS server (and anywhere else where Docker engine is installed). It is truly a superpower. As a developer, you no longer need to worry about the underlying system. After you Dockerize your app, you can be sure that it behaves in the same manner in your development, testing, and production environments, as well as on your local machine. It makes building and testing applications way more comfortable than it was before. 

Another reason why you should be interested in Docker is the popularization of cloud, microservices, and Kubernetes. Docker is the first-class citizen in the cloud-native world, so if you want to take the full advantage of scalable, cloud-native application architectures, Docker is the way to go.

## How to deploy Docker containers

Let's move on to the practical application and usage of Docker. We'll now build a very simple web application that responds to HTTP requests, dockerize it and deploy to Qovery - a scalable **Container as a Service** platform.

### Create a simple application

For the sake of simplicity, we'll create a simple Node.js application that returns a *Hello, World* text in response to HTTP requests. I choose Node.js here because it's simple and popular technology, but you can use Docker with basically any language and framework.

Let's create an empty folder for our new application and initialize an empty Git repository:

```bash
mkdir deploying-docker
cd deploying-docker
git init
```

Now, create `app.js` file with the source code of our server:

```javascript title="app.js"
const http = require('http');

const hostname = '0.0.0.0';
const port = 3000;

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    res.statusCode = 200;
    res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
    res.end('Hello World');
});

server.listen(port, hostname, () => {
    console.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);
});
```

It is a very simple server that returns "Hello World" text on its root endpoint. After it's done, we want to make this app run in a Docker container. To do so, we need to create a Dockerfile.

### What is Dockerfile?

Besides containers, Docker uses the concept of **Images**. Image is a template used to create and run containers. Dockerfile describes the steps required to build the image. Later on, this image is used as a template to run containers with your application. 

You can think about images and containers as a good analogy to classes and objects (instances of a given class) in the Object-Oriented Programming world. 

Create a Dockerfile that will allow us to run our Node.js app in a container. Create a file named `Dockerfile` with the following content:

```dockerfile title="Dockerfile"
FROM node:13-alpine

RUN mkdir -p /usr/src/app

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

COPY . .

EXPOSE 3000

CMD node app.js
```

Let's discuss all lines of the Dockerfile:

- `FROM node:13-alpine` specifies the base of our Docker image. It's a base used to get started with building an image.
- `RUN mkdir -p /usr/src/app` creates a new empty folder in `/usr/src/app`
- `WORKDIR /usr/src/app` defines the *working directory* of our container
- `COPY . .` adds the contents of our application to the container
- `EXPOSE 3000` informs Docker that the container listens on the specified network port at runtime 
- and, finally: `CMD node app.js` is the command that starts our application.

Now we got all basic things we need to run our application in a Docker container! Let's try it out:

1. Build Docker image of the app using `docker build testing/docker .`
2. Run a container with our application by executing `docker run -p 3000:3000 testing/docker`

the `-p 3000:3000` flag makes container port `3000` accessible on your `localhost:3000`.

**Great**! The container is up. Run `docker ps` to see the list of running containers and confirm that it is indeed running.

Now open a browser at `http://localhost:3000` to see that the application in a container responded with `Hello, World` message.

Did it work? Great. Our app works well in the Docker container. It's adorable, but we want to share our app with the world - running applications only on our own machine won't make us millionaires!

### Container as a Service

To deploy our Dockerized application, we'll use Qovery. It's a Container as a Service platform that allows us to deploy Dockerized apps without any efforts. Qovery is free up to three applications (and databases!) in the community version.

### Install Qovery CLI

<Tabs
  centered={true}
  className={"rounded"}
  defaultValue={"linux"}
  placeholder="Select your OS"
  select={false}
  size={null}
  values={[{"group":"Platforms","label":"Linux","value":"linux"},{"group":"Platforms","label":"MacOS","value":"macos"},{"group":"Platforms","label":"Windows","value":"windows"}]}>

<TabItem value="linux">

```bash
# Download and install Qovery CLI on every Linux distribution
$ curl -s https://get.qovery.com | sudo bash
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="macos">

<Tabs
  centered={true}
  className="rounded"
  defaultValue="homebrew"
  values={[{"label":"Homebrew","value":"homebrew"},{"label":"Manual","value":"manual"}]}>

<TabItem value="homebrew">

The common solution to install a command line binary on the MacOS is to use [Homebrew][urls.brew].

```bash
# Add Qovery brew repository
$ brew tap Qovery/qovery-cli

# Install the CLI
$ brew install qovery-cli
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="manual">

```bash
# Install the Qovery CLI on MacOS manually
$ curl -s https://get.qovery.com | bash
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="windows">

<Tabs
  centered={true}
  className="rounded"
  defaultValue="scoop"
  values={[{"label":"Scoop","value":"scoop"},{"label":"Manual","value":"manual"}]}>

<TabItem value="scoop">

The classic way to install binaries on Windows is to use [Scoop][urls.scoop].

```bash
# Add Qovery bucket
$ scoop bucket add qovery https://github.com/Qovery/scoop-qovery-cli

# Install the CLI
$ scoop install qovery-cli
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="manual">

Install the Qovery CLI on Windows manually by downloading the [latest realease][urls.qovery_cli_releases], and uncompress its content to
`C:\Windows`.

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

Few limitations exist on Windows: [read more][docs.cli#windows]

</TabItem>

</Tabs>



### Sign up
```bash
# Sign up and sign in command
$ qovery auth
```

<Alert type="info">

If you are using an environment without access to GUI or a browser, you can use headless authentication instead:

```bash
# Sign up and sign in command
$ qovery auth --headless
```

</Alert>

Your browser window with sign-in options will open.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/qovery_signup.svg" alt="Qovery Sign-up page" />
</p>

Note: Qovery needs access to your account to be able to clone your repository for future application builds.

[Click here][urls.authorize_qovery] to authorize Qovery to clone and build your applications.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/github_signup.svg" alt="Connect Github" />
</p>

Congratulations, you are logged-in.



### Permissions

<Tabs
  centered={true}
  className={"rounded"}
  defaultValue={"github"}
  placeholder="Select your Git provider"
  select={false}
  size={null}
  values={[{"group":"Git","label":"Github","value":"github"},{"group":"Git","label":"Gitlab","value":"gitlab"}]}>

<TabItem value="github">

Qovery needs to get access to your Github account to deploy the application.

**[Click here to give access!][urls.authorize_qovery]**

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="gitlab">

Are you hosting your projects on Gitlab? We got you covered!
Simply sign in to Qovery using your Gitlab account and enable Qovery in your project using:

```bash
# enables Qovery for the project in current working directory
$ qovery git enable
```

That's it! It's a one time process that needs to be performed in each of your Gitlab projects that makes Gitlab send notifications about events happening in your repository.

In the future, Qovery will allow you to manage your projects directly in Gitlab and Qovery UI.

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

After you have access to Qovery, it's time to deploy the application.

### Deploy the docker container

1. Run `qovery init`
2. Choose application name, e.g., `node-app`
3. Choose project name, e.g., `testing-docker`
4. Commit and push your changes to Github: `git add . ; git commit -m "Initial commit" ; git push -u origin master"` (create an empty repository beforefor your application on Github before if it's not done yet)

Voila! That's all. Your Dockerized application is being deployed as a Docker container. To deploy a Docker container on Qovery, all you need is a Dockerfile that describes containers with your application + running `qovery init` command to initialize Qovery. From now on, Qovery will build and deploy your Dockerized application after you make any changes in your repository to scalable Kubernetes clusters as a Docker container.

To check that your application is in fact deploying, run `qovery status`:

```bash title="Output"
BRANCH NAME       | STATUS  | ENDPOINTS                            | APPLICATIONS    | DATABASES
master            | running | https://some.url.qovery.io           | node-app  | 

APPLICATION NAME  | STATUS  | DATABASES
node-app          | running | 

DATABASE NAME     | STATUS  | TYPE       | VERSION | ENDPOINT | PORT     | USERNAME | PASSWORD | APPLICATIONS
```
