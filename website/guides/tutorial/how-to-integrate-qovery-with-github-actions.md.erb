Getting starting with Qovery is easy. Just plug your Git repository and you can deploy your application directly.
But in some cases you will want a more advanced CI workflow where some steps need to happen before deployment.

One of the CI tools you can use for that matter is GitHub actions.

<Assumptions name="guide">

* You have a Qovery cluster running.
* You are using GitHub Actions as a CI server.
* You have a Qovery application deployed.
* You have the Qovery CLI installed and configured.

</Assumptions>

If you don't have an application running on Qovery yet, check [the documentation](https://hub.qovery.com/docs/getting-started/deploy-my-app/) to create one.

## Goal

In this tutorial, we will deploy an application with the official Qovery GitHub action.

You can find it [on the marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/qovery-deploy).

## Get your application ready

The first thing we need to do, is to disable automatic deployments. By default, Qovery applications get re-deployed whenever you push some code to the configured branch.
Since we want to trigger the deployment through GitHub Actions, we need to disable this behavior.

Go to your environment page, then click `Settings`:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/how-to-integrate-qovery-with-github-actions/1.png" alt="" />
</p>

Then go to `Deployment` and on the `Auto-deploy` dropdown, select `Off`:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/how-to-integrate-qovery-with-github-actions/2.png" alt="" />
</p>

Click save and close the modal.

## Add your GitHub action Workflow

We will now add a GitHub Actions workflow to your application. Workflow are defined with YAML configuration files that are placed in the code directory of your application.
As an example we will define a workflow for a NodeJS application. We will first run our unit tests, then launch the Qovery deployment if the tests pass. 

You can adapt those steps for your own stack and needs. Read the [GitHub Actions documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) to learn more.

<Steps headingDepth={3}>

<ol>

<li>

#### Create the Workflows directory

All your workflows files must be stored in a specific `.github/workflows` directory. Create this directory at the root of your project.

</li>

<li>

#### Add a Test and Deploy workflow

In your Workflows folder, create a `test-and-deploy.yaml` file with the following content: 

```yaml
name: Test And Deploy to Qovery
on:
  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      organization-id:
        required: true
        type: string     
      environment-id:
        required: true
        type: string 
      application-ids:
        required: true
        type: string                        
    secrets:
      api-token:
        required: true
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Install modules
      run: yarn
    - name: Run tests
      run: yarn test
  deploy:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Deploy on Qovery
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Deploy on Qovery
        uses: Qovery/qovery-action@v0.10
        id: qovery
        with:
          qovery-organization-id: ${{ inputs.organization-id }} 
          qovery-environment-id: ${{ inputs.environment-id }}
          qovery-application-ids: ${{ inputs.application-ids }}
          qovery-api-token: ${{ secrets.api-token }}
```

- We give it a name `Test And Deploy to Qovery`. It could be anything.
- The `on` section contains a `workflow_call` directive. It means that this workflow will be triggered when called from another workflow. 
  We're doing this because we won't use this workflow directly. Since we might have several environments to deploy to Qovery depending on the branch, we could have one workflow per environment and we want to avoid repeating all the steps.
- The `inputs` and `secrets` sections are defining the values that we will need to pass to our workflow
- The `jobs` section lists the `jobs` and the `steps` that in needs to accomplish. Here we have two jobs and five steps:
  - `test` where we checkout the code, we install Yarn modules and we run tests through Jest
  - `deploy` where we checkout the code and deploy to Qovery.

Several things worth noting:

- Our `deploy` job has a `needs` instructions, telling GitHub Actions that this job can only run when the `test` job succeeds. 
- The `with` section of our last `deploy` step contains interpolated strings: ${{ inputs.xxxx }}. Those are values passed to our workflow, that our Qovery action needs. They will be passed from the calling workflow.

</li>

<li>

#### Add an actual workflow

Now we will add a deployment workflow that will be called every time we push our code to the `main` branch to deploy our `production` environment. 

```yaml
name: Deploy to production
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  test-and-deploy:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/test-and-deploy.yaml
    with:
      organization-id: XXX
      environment-id: XXX
      application-ids: XXX
    secrets:
      api-token: ${{ secrets.QOVERY_API_TOKEN }} 
```

- We are setting the `on` section with a `push` directive pointing to the `main` branch. It means that this workflow will be executed when we push code to the `main` branch.
- Our `test-and-deploy` job calls our previously created workflow with the `use` instruction.
- In the `with` section, we are passing IDs corresponding to the application we want to deploy.
- In the `secret` section, we are reading our API key from a GitHub secret we will create later.

</li>

<li>

#### Get the Organization, Environment and Application ids

First we need to get the IDs that we will to add to our YAML file. To get those IDs, go to the application page and look at the URL in your browser:

The URL looks like this: 

```
https://console.qovery.com/platform/organization/[organization-id]/projects/xxx/environments/[environment-id]/applications/[application-id]/summary
```

Copy those values and add them to the YAML file.

</li>

<li>

#### Get a Qovery API token

To get an API token, use the Qovery CLI:

```bash
qovery token
```

- Select your organization. (tokens are valid for only one organization).
- Enter a name for your token.
- Enter a description for your token.

You will get an output like this one: 

```
qovery token Qovery: ---- Never share this authentication token and keep it secure ----
Qovery: qov_xxx....
Qovery: ---- Never share this authentication token and keep it secure ----
```

<Alert type="warning">
At the time of writing, we don't have a way to invalidate tokens. Store it carefully.
</Alert>


</li>

<li>

#### Add your token to your GitHub repository secrets

Go to your GitHub repository then to the `Settings`:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/how-to-integrate-qovery-with-github-actions/3.png" alt="" />
</p>

Got to the `Secrets/Actions` section and click on `New repository secret`:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/how-to-integrate-qovery-with-github-actions/4.png" alt="" />
</p>

Add your secret with the name `QOVERY_API_TOKEN` and save:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/how-to-integrate-qovery-with-github-actions/5.png" alt="" />
</p>

</li>

</ol>

</Steps>

## Push your code

We're done with the setup. You can now push your code to the `main` branch. If you did it properly, under the `Actions` tab on your GitHub repository, you should see your job being run.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/how-to-integrate-qovery-with-github-actions/6.png" alt="" />
</p>

You can click on it to see the details of the jobs. Once the testing phase is green, it will start the deployment job.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/how-to-integrate-qovery-with-github-actions/7.png" alt="" />
</p>

As soon as the job is setup and it starts actually deploying, go to the Qovery console and check that your application is actually being deployed.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/how-to-integrate-qovery-with-github-actions/8.png" alt="" />
</p>

## Deploy several applications in the same environment

Most of the time, you will have several applications in your environment (e.g. a `backend` and a `frontend`). To deploy all of them through the action, you can add all the ids separated by commas:

```
...

jobs:
  test-and-deploy:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/test-and-deploy.yaml
    with:
      organization-id: XXX
      environment-id: XXX
      application-ids: id1,id2,id3...
    secrets:
      api-token: ${{ secrets.QOVERY_API_TOKEN }}
```

## Advanced usecases 

<Alert type="warning">
At the time of writing, the Qovery GitHub Action only supports deployments. Other features will be added in the future
</Alert>

For some other usecases, like `preview environments`, you can use the scripts we provide [here](https://hub.qovery.com/docs/using-qovery/addon/continuous-integration/github-actions/).

## Conclusion

Integrating Qovery with GitHub actions enables more complex workflows than just deploying on code push. You can make sure your test suite succeeds before deploying
or anything else you need, without sacrificing the simplicity of deployment Qovery brings you.
