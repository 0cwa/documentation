This tutorial describes how to migrate your web application running on Heroku to Qovery. In the article, you learn how to
migrate a Node.js application connected to Heroku Postgres as a backing service on the Heroku platform. It covers all required
steps you need to take to deploy your application on Qovery and transfer your data from Heroku Postgres to the database managed
by Qovery.

The application is a simple Node.js *Todo* web app that uses PostgreSQL as a persistence layer.

<Assumptions name="guide">

* You are familiar with Heroku basics, have a Heroku account and access to Heroku CLI
* You have a Qovery account
* You have a [Github or Gitlab][urls.github] account

</Assumptions>

If you have an existing app, you do not have to deploy our sample application to benefit from this guide.
Otherwise, you can try to deploy and migrate our sample application to get experience.

## Deploying the sample application to Heroku

<Steps headingDepth={3}>

  1. Log in to Heroku using the CLI:
  ```bash
  heroku login --interactive
  ```

  2. Clone the application repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/qovery/migrate-webapp-from-heroku-to-qovery.git
  ```

  3. Move to the directory of the cloned repository:
  ```bash
  cd migrate-webapp-from-heroku-to-qovery
  ```
  The repository is made of a few simple components:
    - `index.js` - Node.js script for setting up the web application.
    - `package.json` - File determining app's dependencies.
    - `Procfile` - File required to run the app on Heroku. It determines the command executed on the application startup.
    - `views` - Directory with the HTML served by the app.

  4. Create a Heroku app:
  ```bash
  heroku create
  ```

  5. Add Heroku PostgreSQL to your application:
  ```bash
  heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev
  ```

  6. Deploy the application:
  ```
  git push heroku master
  ```

  7. Check your application URL:
  ```bash
  heroku info
  ```

  8. In the browser, navigate to your application's URL - you'll see a simple view with a *Todo* app:
  <p align="center">
    <img src="/img/todo-app-example.png" alt="Connect Github" />
  </p>

  9. Create a few *Todo* tasks in the UI to make sure you have sample data in the database.

## Migrating the application from Heroku to Qovery

<Steps headingDepth={3}>
<ol>

<li>

[Sign in to Qovery Console](https://console.qovery.com)

</li>
<li>

Create a new project

</li>
<li>

Create a new environment

</li>
<li>

Create a new application

To follow the guide, [you can fork and use our example repository](https://github.com/qovery/migrate-webapp-from-heroku-to-qovery.git)

</li>
<li>

Create and deploy a new database (name it **MY_POSTGRESQL** to follow the guide flawlessly)

To learn how to do it, you can [follow this guide][guides.getting-started.create-a-database]

</li>

<li>

Migrate PostgreSQL data

There are multiple paths you could take to migrate your data from Heroku Postgres to Qovery.
For production usage for the shortest downtime you would probably want to configure Qovery PostgreSQL as a replica to
the database on Heroku, and making it the primary instance after migration. Heroku does not support this in its free
tier, so for the purpose of the example, we take a simpler path and use different tools to migrate the data.

<Alert>

To run the migration successfully, you need a `psql` PostgreSQL client installed on your machine.

</Alert>

First, dump the data from your Heroku Postgres:

```bash
heroku pg:backups:download -a YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME
heroku pg:backups:capture -a YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME
```

It results in creating a new `latest.dump` file, which you use to transfer data to Qovery.

To migrate the data to Qovery, run (replace all the values with secrets listed in your application `Secrets` tab):

```bash
pg_restore -v -h $QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_POSTGRESQL_HOST -U $QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_POSTGRESQL_USER -d postgres latest.dump --no-owner
```

</li>

<li>

Deploy app on Qovery

All you have to do now is to navigate to your application and click **Deploy** button

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/heroku/heroku-1.png" alt="Migrate from Heroku" />
</p>

That's it. Watch the status and wait till the app is deployed.

After it's done, click on **Action** and **Open** button to navigate to your app. It should be up and running with all the data from Heroku migrated to Qovery!

</li>

</ol>
</Steps>
