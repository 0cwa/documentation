This tutorial describes how to migrate your web application running on Heroku to Qovery. In the article, you learn how to
migrate a Node.js application connected to Heroku Postgres as a backing service on the Heroku platform. It covers all required
steps you need to take to deploy your application on Qovery and transfer your data from Heroku Postgres to the database managed
by Qovery.

The application is a simple Node.js *Todo* web app that uses PostgreSQL as a persistence layer.

<Assumptions name="guide">

* You are familiar with Heroku basics, have a Heroku account and access to Heroku CLI
* You have a Qovery account and access to Qovery CLI
* You have a [Github][urls.github] account

If you have not installed the Qovery CLI yet, you can see steps to do it [here][docs.using-qovery.interface.cli#first-usage].

</Assumptions>

If you have an existing app, you do not have to deploy our sample application to benefit from this guide.
Otherwise, you can try to deploy and migrate our sample application to get experience.

## Deploying the sample application to Heroku

<Steps headingDepth={3}>

  1. Log in to Heroku using the CLI:
  ```bash
  heroku login --interactive
  ```

  2. Clone the application repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/qovery/migrate-webapp-from-heroku-to-qovery.git
  ```

  3. Move to the directory of the cloned repository:
  ```bash
  cd migrate-webapp-from-heroku-to-qovery
  ```
  The repository is made of a few simple components:
    - `index.js` - Node.js script for setting up the web application.
    - `package.json` - File determining app's dependencies.
    - `Procfile` - File required to run the app on Heroku. It determines the command executed on the application startup.
    - `views` - Directory with the HTML served by the app.

  4. Create a Heroku app:
  ```bash
  heroku create
  ```

  5. Add Heroku PostgreSQL to your application:
  ```bash
  heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev
  ```

  6. Deploy the application:
  ```
  git push heroku master
  ```

  7. Check your application URL:
  ```bash
  heroku info
  ```

  8. In the browser, navigate to your application's URL - you'll see a simple view with a *Todo* app:
  <p align="center">
    <img src="/img/todo-app-example.png" alt="Connect Github" />
  </p>

  9. Create a few *Todo* tasks in the UI to make sure you have sample data in the database.

## Migrating the application from Heroku to Qovery

<Alert>

Contents of the `Dockerfile` and `.qovery.yml` assumes that you migrate our sample application

</Alert>

### Dockerize the application

As Qovery uses Docker for the runtime of applications, you need first to Dockerize the application. To do so,
create a file named `Dockerfile` in the root of application repository with the following content:

```dockerfile title="Dockerfile"
FROM node:10-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . /app
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

If you want to learn more about Docker, you can read our introductory article:

<Jump to="/guides/tutorial/how-to-deploy-a-docker-container/">Docker Containers</Jump>

### Initialize Qovery

To set up the application for Qovery deployment with a PostgreSQL database, create a `.qovery.yml` file in the root of the project with the following content:

```yml title=".qovery.yml"
application:
  name: node-todo-app
  project: migrate-from-heroku
  publicly_accessible: true
databases:
- type: postgresql
  version: "11.5"
  name: my-postgresql-database
routers:
- name: main
  routes:
  - application_name: node-todo-app
    paths:
    - /
```

The sample application uses `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to connect to PostgreSQL. To provide your app
with correct database URL, create a `.env` file in the root of application repository with this content:

```plain title=".env"
DATABASE_URL=$QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_POSTGRESQL_DATABASE_CONNECTION_URI
```

Adding this file populates the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable (that is consumed often on Heroku)
with database URL provided by Qovery.

### Deploy the application to Qovery

All you need to do to deploy the application to Qovery is to commit and push a repository containing `Dockerfile` and `.qovery.yml` to Github.
Qovery needs access to this repository to build and deploy the application.

1. [Create a Github repository](https://github.com/new)

2. Remove current git configuration from the repository you cloned:
```bash
rm -rf .git
```

3. Initialize a new repository and commit all files:
```
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Deploying to Qovery"
```

4. Push the local repository to the newly created Github repo (replace placeholders in the code below):
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/$YOUR_NAME/$YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
git push -u origin master
```

Good job! It's all you need to do to deploy your application with a database to Qovery.
To confirm that your application is, in fact, deploying, run `qovery status`.

The output of the above command could look like this:

```bash title="Output"
BRANCH NAME       | STATUS  | ENDPOINTS                                   | APPLICATIONS    | DATABASES
master            | running | https:/your.app.url.qovery.io               | node-todo-app   | my-postgresql-database

APPLICATION NAME  | STATUS  | DATABASES
node-todo-app     | running | my-postgresql-database

DATABASE NAME            | STATUS  | TYPE         | VERSION  | ENDPOINT | PORT     | USERNAME | PASSWORD | APPLICATIONS
my-postgresql-database   | running | POSTGRESQL   | 11.5     | <hidden> | <hidden> | <hidden> | <hidden> | node-todo-app
```

The application should be deployed in a few minutes. When it's status is `running`, open the browser
using address specified in the `ENDPOINTS` section of `qovery status` output.

You should see the same application you previously deployed to Heroku, yet without the data from the database.

### Migrate PostgreSQL data

There are multiple paths you could take to migrate your data from Heroku Postgres to Qovery.
For production usage for the shortest downtime you would probably want to configure Qovery PostgreSQL as a replica to
the database on Heroku, and making it the primary instance after migration. Heroku does not support this in its free
tier, so for the purpose of the example, we take a simpler path and use different tools to migrate the data.

<Alert>

To run the migration successfully, you need a `psql` PostgreSQL client installed on your machine.

</Alert>

First, dump the data from your Heroku Postgres:

```bash
heroku pg:backups:download -a YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME
heroku pg:backups:capture -a YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME
```

It results in creating a new `latest.dump` file, which you use to transfer data to Qovery.

To migrate the data to Qovery, run (replace all placeholders with values you get from running `qovery application env list -c`):

```bash
pg_restore -v -h $DATABASE_HOST -U $DATABASE_USER -d postgres latest.dump --no-owner
```

In the browser, navigate to your application URL deployed on Qovery. Now you should see all the data you had in your database hosted on Heroku. Well done!
