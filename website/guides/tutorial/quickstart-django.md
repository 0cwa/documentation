This tutorial will have you deploying a **Django** app in minutes.

Django is a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. Built by experienced developers, Django takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. It is free and open source, has a thriving and active community, great documentation, and many options for free and paid-for support.

## Source Code

In the tutorial, we will use a sample application ready to be deployed on Qovery. To get the application source code, please [fork this repository](https://github.com/Qovery/qovery-python-django-sample).

## App Setup

In [Qovery Console](https://start.qovery.com), choose or create your project and environment. Then, add a new application:

<p>
    <img src="/img/quickstart-1.png" alt="Django" />
</p>

In **Git Repository**, pick the forked application source code repository.

In the **Port** section type **8000**.

That's it, create!

## Env Vars

The last step is to add a **PORT** environment variable. To do so, navigate to your application and add a new **PORT** variable with value **8000**:

<p>
    <img src="/img/quickstart-3.png" alt="Django" />
</p>

## Deploy

It's all ready. In your application's screen click on **Actions** and **Deploy** your application.

<p>
    <img src="/img/quickstart-4.png" alt="Django" />
</p>

## Logs

To see the progress of your deployment and the output of your application, click on **Show Logs** button. You can navigate between build/deployment logs as well as your application runtime logs.

## Push Changes

Now, anytime you push new changes to your repository, Qovery will automatically update your application with the latest code!
