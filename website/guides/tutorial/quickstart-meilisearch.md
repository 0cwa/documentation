This tutorial will have you deploying a **Meilisearch** app in minutes.

MeiliSearch is a powerful, fast, open-source, easy to use and deploy search engine. Both searching and indexing are highly customizable. Features such as typo-tolerance, filters, and synonyms are provided out-of-the-box.

## Source Code

In the tutorial, we will use a sample application ready to be deployed on Qovery. To get the application source code, please [fork this repository](https://github.com/Qovery/qovery-meilisearch-sample).

## App Setup

In [Qovery Console](https://console.qovery.com), choose or create your project and environment. Then, add a new application:

<p>
    <img src="/img/quickstart-1.png" alt="Meilisearch" />
</p>

In **Git Repository**, pick the forked application source code repository.

In the **Port** section type **7700**.

Lastly, in the **Build Mode** pick **Docker** and leave the **Dockerfile Path** as it is - `/Dockerfile`.

That's it, create!

## Deploy

It's all ready. In your application's screen click on **Actions** and **Deploy** your application.

<p>
    <img src="/img/quickstart-4.png" alt="Meilisearch" />
</p>

## Logs

To see the progress of your deployment and the output of your application, click on **Show Logs** button. You can navigate between build/deployment logs as well as your application runtime logs.

## Push Changes

Now, anytime you push new changes to your repository, Qovery will automatically update your application with the latest code!
