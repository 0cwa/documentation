This tutorial will have you deploying a **Sinatra** app in minutes.

Sinatra is a free and open source software web application library and domain-specific language written in Ruby. It is an alternative to other Ruby web application frameworks such as Ruby on Rails, Merb, Nitro, and Camping. It is dependent on the Rack web server interface.

## Source Code

In the tutorial, we will use a sample application ready to be deployed on Qovery. To get the application source code, please [fork this repository](https://github.com/Qovery/qovery-ruby-sinatra-sample).

## App Setup

In [Qovery Console](https://start.qovery.com), choose or create your project and environment. Then, add a new application:

<p>
    <img src="/img/quickstart-1.png" alt="Sinatra" />
</p>

In **Git Repository**, pick the forked application source code repository.

In the **Port** section type **8080**.

That's it, create!

## Env Vars

The last step is to add a **PORT** environment variable. To do so, navigate to your application and add a new **PORT** variable with value **8080**:

<p>
    <img src="/img/quickstart-3.png" alt="Sinatra" />
</p>

## Deploy

It's all ready. In your application's screen click on **Actions** and **Deploy** your application.

<p>
    <img src="/img/quickstart-4.png" alt="Sinatra" />
</p>

## Logs

To see the progress of your deployment and the output of your application, click on **Show Logs** button. You can navigate between build/deployment logs as well as your application runtime logs.

<p>
    <img src="/img/quickstart-5.png" alt="Sinatra" />
</p>

## Push Changes

Now, anytime you push new changes to your repository, Qovery will automatically update your application with the latest code!
