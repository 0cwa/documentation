Deno is a secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript based on the V8 engine and Rust programming language. It was created by Ryan Dahl, the same person who is the creator of good ol’ Node.js.

This article is not meant to teach you Deno, but it’s worth to mention its main cool features:

- Secure by default, runs in a sandbox. No file, network, or environment access, unless explicitly enabled. You need to add flags to gain permissions.
- TypeScript compiler baked in, works out of the box.
- Has built-in utilities like a dependency inspector (deno info) and a code formatter (deno fmt).
- Ships only a single executable file.
- Decentralized packages. No more NPM packages / package.json. Packages are imported from URLs and are cached on the hard drive on load.
- Extensive standard library.
- ES Modules import syntax over require syntax.
- Browser compatible API e.g. fetch.

Without further due, let's move on to next post section where we'll deploy a Deno application with MongoDB on scalable cloud platform.
