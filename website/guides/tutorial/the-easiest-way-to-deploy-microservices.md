All developers are not equal, some know how to deploy their applications, others don‚Äôt. But now it‚Äôs over! With [Qovery](https://www.qovery.com), all developers can deploy their application in the Cloud in just a few seconds.

Qovery integrates seamlessly with Github and requires no effort from the developer.

We know how it can be painful for developers to deploy applications, manage staging/development/features environments, synchronize databases and all system stuff - even in the Cloud.

Developers should spend time doing what they love - developing applications, instead of wasting time on configuring databases, CDN, cache, network... That's why we decided to create Qovery. The first Container as a Service platform that allows any developer (junior, senior, backend, frontend...) to deploy applications in just a few minutes.

<Assumptions name="guide">

* You have installed the [Qovery CLI](https://docs.qovery.com/extending-qovery/cli)
* You host your code on Github

</Assumptions>

## Deploying application
Qovery is fully integrated into Github. Basically, you just need to have a **.qovery.yml** and a **Dockerfile** at the root of your project. Once it is done, commit and push your code. You‚Äôre done!

Generate the **.qovery.yml** file

```bash
cd simple-example-node
# checkout this sample project
# https://github.com/Qovery/simple-example-node

qovery init
cat .qovery.yml
```

```yaml
application:
  name: simple-example-node
  project: simple-example-node
  publicly_accessible: true
routers:
- name: main
  routes:
  - application_name: simple-example-node
    paths:
    - /*
```

Add your **Dockerfile** to the root folder of your project (*here is a Dockerfile for my NodeJS project*)

```bash
FROM node:13-alpine
RUN mkdir -p /usr/src/app
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY . .
RUN npm install
EXPOSE 3000
CMD node ./bin/www

```

Commit and push your code
```bash
git add .qovery.yml Dockerfile
git commit -m "Add .qovery.yml and Dockerfile"
git push -u origin master
```

Congratulations, you have deployed your application.

```bash
qovery status --watch
```

## Update application
You just have modified your app and you want to deploy it? Well, it‚Äôs straightforward, just **commit**, **push** and that‚Äôs it!

```bash
git commit -m "my updated code"
git push -u origin master
```

## Application rollback
Oh! you miss something and you need to rollback to a previous version of your application? No worries, it's as simple as one command

```bash
qovery deploy list
branch  date          commit id                                 deployed
master  5 hours ago   2cad27c442e8022677e91a2ad3eb585adc18126a  ‚úì

## Staging branch
Sometimes you want to validate your code in a staging environment before putting it in production. That‚Äôs why we created the concept of ‚ÄúEnvironment‚Äù. Which is having isolated applications and services (databases, brokers, storage) for each branch. There is no risk to impact the production if something bad happens.

![A staging isolated environment](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5de176c0d41c9b4a1dbbb0aa/5e3a8ff19368910953fb88a8_staging%20nodejs.png)

Having a staging environment is as easy as creating a new branch with the name ‚Äú**staging**‚Äù

```bash
git checkout -b staging
git push -u origin staging
```

That‚Äôs it!

And obviously, you can track the status of your deployment in real time
```bash
qovery status --watch
```

## Feature branch
Same as for the staging branch above, every branch that you create is per default an isolated environment. So just create your branch, and push your changes, a new isolated environment is live in a couple of seconds.

![A feature isolated environment from the staging environment](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5de176c0d41c9b4a1dbbb0aa/5e3a9017d565b245b23b1aaf_feature%20nodejs.png)

```bash
git checkout -b feat_x
git push -u origin feat_x

# watch status of the feat_x deployment
qovery status --watch
```

## Database natively supported
Do you need a database? We support the most popular SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB, Elasticsearch, Redis, Memcached, Cassandra) databases. Thanks to AWS managed services for the reliability and the performances.

Supporting a database is as simple as updating the **.qovery.yml**

```yaml
application:
  name: simple-example-node
  project: simple-example-node
  publicly_accessible: true
# add this section
databases:
- type: postgresql
  version: "11.5"
  name: my-postgresql-db
# end
routers:
- name: main
  routes:
  - application_name: simple-example-node
    paths:
    - /*
```

To deploy the PostgreSQL database you need to commit and push the *.qovery.yml*

```bash
git add .qovery.yml
git commit -m "add postgresql database to the project"
git push -u origin master
```

![The master environment now contains a PostgreSQL database](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5de176c0d41c9b4a1dbbb0aa/5e3a90dc8ec6e5488ac91d44_master%20node%20pql.png)

### What is going on if I create a new branch with a database?
The database and all its data are cloned as well.
Note: If you don‚Äôt want to clone the data, it is as well possible.

![Each branch have their own isolated environment (application + database)](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5de176c0d41c9b4a1dbbb0aa/5e3a91108c461071e0e775ad_feature%20node%20pql.png)

## Multiple applications and databases in one project
Let‚Äôs imagine that you need to have a backend API and a frontend website that work together. These 2 apps belong to the same project. Meaning, they need to communicate with each other within the same environment. Obviously, this is natively possible with Qovery.

![isolated environments with multiple applications (NodeJS + React) and multiple databases (PostgreSQL + Redis)](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5de176c0d41c9b4a1dbbb0aa/5e3a915f46ac5798fe3a2918_complete%20env.png)

For instance:

Repository A is a backend API made with NodeJS -> connected to a PostgreSQL database and Redis key/value store

Repository B is a frontend made in React -> connected to the backend API

Project A **.qovery.yml** file
```yaml
application:
  name: backend-api
  project: my-multi-apps-project
  publicly_accessible: true
databases:
- type: postgresql
  version: "11.5"
  name: my-postgresql-db
- type: redis
  version: "5.0"
  name: my-redis
routers:
- name: api
  routes:
  - application_name: backend-api
    paths:
    - /*
```

Project B **.qovery.yml** file
```yaml
application:
  name: frontend
  project: my-multi-apps-project
  publicly_accessible: true
routers:
- name: web
  routes:
  - application_name: frontend
    paths:
    - /*
```

You can note that they have the same ‚Äúproject‚Äù name. This is the parameter to make them belong to the same project.
On the other side, routers have different properties to properly route the traffic according to their application.

## Conclusion
Qovery is the swiss army knife of all developers who want to deploy their application while staying focused on their code. No need to learn how to use AWS to deploy on it. Our goal is to provide the best developer experience ever.
